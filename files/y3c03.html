<h2>Interlude of Weirdness</h2>

<stage>Deep inside the caverns of the Kiyomi Mountains, &quot;The 
 Clergy&quot; finishes a morning chant ritual and gathers to listen to 
 their leader in the white robe. A figure in a blue robe reverently approaches 
 the leader, genuflects and bows.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> We await your word</line>

<stage>The white robe slowly circles around the blue robe and 
 then suddenly kicks the figure across the floor.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> The word is disappointment</line>

<stage>Another blue robe steps forward and falls to its knees.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> Although we had some difficulties, last night was 
 moderately successful</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Please point out to me the success</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> We have eliminated a major obstacle in Karl von 
 Meer - drilling will now commence at a more rapid pace</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Tell me, where is his body?</line>

<stage>The other hooded figures in the room all look at each 
 other.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> (Trying not to stammer) At the morgue</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> (Inching closer) Are you sure of this?</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> Very sure</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Did you see the body with your own eyes?</line>

<stage>The Blue Robe does not respond. In turn, the leader violently 
 lifts it off of the ground with one hand.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> I asked you a question</line>

<stage>The captive can only respond by choking and gasping. 
 It is thrown back down to the ground.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> I am waiting</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> (Sucking in air) I... we followed him... to the 
 hospital... we saw him flatline in the ER... we assumed he was shipped... 
 to the coroner's office</line>

<stage>The leader slaps the subordinate hard across the head.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> ASSUME NOTHING - TWO OF YOU, GO NOW AND CONFIRM 
 THE BODY</line>

<stage>A pair quickly rises and exits the room.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Does anyone else here care to justify how last 
 night was a success?</line>

<stage>Yet another blue robed figure speaks out.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> Forgive us, Master, we did not expect the aberration 
 to adapt so quickly</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> But she did, didn't she?</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> We have figured out the modulation she used last 
 night and we will be prepared for her the next time</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Her trident is not a concern, her physical alteration 
 is!</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> We are still working on theories</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Work harder - I want proven conclusions, not theories!</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> Yes, Master</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Have we discovered the user of the rocket launcher?</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> It was a government-issue rocket launcher favored 
 by the CIA and the user was definitely female</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Another added element we do not need</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> We are putting together a sketch of her face and 
 we will hunt this woman down</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> That can wait, I want all of you searching for 
 The Marked One - is that clear?</line>

<stage>A unanimous affirmative is heard from the gathering. 
 Another blue robe enters the room and approaches the leader but does 
 not bow.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> Actually, we do have a bright spot from last night... 
 literally - BRING HER IN 
</line>
<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c03_amy.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>
<stage>Two other hooded figures drag in Amethyst Hill and throw 
 her at the feet of the leader. She is covered in tribal mud paint and 
 is missing her crystal necklace.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> I am certain she will be able to tell you where 
 The Marked One is!</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> (Kneeling and carefully lifting her face) Disclose 
 her location</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Jerking away) Never, father... NEVER</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Staring at the ruins of their former storefront, Penelope 
 Renselier and Brad Martel sit on the curb in silence as firefighters 
 and other emergency personnel secure the block.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Studying Brad) You know, we could be in body bags right 
 now</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Almost got your wish, didn't you?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> I never want to die like that - my death will be of 
 my own choosing</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Glad you think you have a say in that matter</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> What I want to know is where did Morri and Amy go?</line>

<stage>Brad shrugs his shoulders and continues to stare off 
 into space.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Softly) We searched the rubble, bit by bit, FOUR times... 
 where did they go?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Hanging his head) Just be glad we DIDN'T find them</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> They couldn't have just vanished</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Well, it appears that they did</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> There is something seriously psycho with those two... 
 and I'm not talking about barging in on us last night without their 
 clothes</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> These past several hours have been... I don't know</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> An interlude of weirdness?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> That's why you're a wordsmith!</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Did you notice the type of destruction?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> What do you mean?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> If you look at the surrounding buildings on our block, 
 they look normal</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Eyeing the devastation) You think that looks normal?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Normal as in hit by a good-sized quake, yes - but look 
 at our building...</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Same thing</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> No... REALLY look</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I must be exhausted and blind because I have no clue 
 what you're referring to</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Our building... or what's left of it... has a concentric 
 implosion pattern while every other building is more random</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Finally seeing the difference) Huh, that's strange... 
 AND?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> What do you mean &quot;and?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> And what does that tell you? - it's still destroyed, 
 but in a prettier way - BIG FUCKING DEAL</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> It IS a big deal!</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Why? - does that mean we'll get more insurance money 
 out of it or that it will look better on the KCON news footage of local 
 damage?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> You just don't get it</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> No, I don't - and I don't really want to - we have other 
 things to worry about</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Rubbing Brad's back) Stop stressing - you can get one 
 of those SBA disaster loans or something</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Not with my record</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Then you can always ask your family</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Flinging a chunk of brick) Screw that!</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Now is so not the time to be stubborn</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Now is the time to shut the hell up, here come the cops!</line>

<stage>Two police officers with a dog and a detective come over 
 to Brad and Penny.</stage>

<line><actor>Detective</actor> Are you two alright?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Considering we just lost our building and our business, 
 I guess we are</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> Do you two need any help?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Keep on walking, that would help</line>

<stage>Brad elbows her in the side.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> We'll be fine, sir, thank you</line>

<stage>The dog leads the officers over to the rubble and barks 
 anxiously.</stage>

<line><actor>Detective</actor> (Pulling out a photo of Morrigan and Amethyst) Have 
 you seen either of these two women recently?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Glancing at the picture) No, not recently</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Why, what did they do?</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> One is a fugitive from justice and the other, we 
 believe, is assisting her on the run</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Cool</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> No, NOT cool - if you know where they are, we need 
 to know... now!</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Sorry, can't help you</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Try looking in your underwear, maybe you'll find something 
 of interest in there</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Shaking her arm) Penny, stop it!</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> Well, apparently our K-9 corps has found an interesting 
 scent coming from your building</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> We specialize in candles and incense, not to mention 
 the dead rats and gas leaks, I'm sure there are a lot of interesting 
 scents coming from our building!</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> The dog is trained to pick up the scent of Ms. McBride 
 and Ms. Hill</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> The dog is also freaked by the earthquake - animals 
 are skittish and confused for days after</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> You are more that welcome to check the remains of our 
 store if you don't believe us</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> (Walking off) I might just do that</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Yeah, they might be hiding under a shard of glass, be 
 sure to look closely you pig prick!</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Covering her mouth on the last two words) WHAT IS WRONG 
 WITH YOU?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Snapping Brad's hand away) WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? 
 - &quot;WE'LL BE FINE, SIR, THANK YOU&quot; - WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Someone who is NOT looking for more trouble right now</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Since when did you turn kiss-ass to authority?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Since I can't afford another strike on my record</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> You can't afford another strike on your bad boy rep 
 - I might as well be with Jere</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Evil grin) But, you're not</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Leaning over to kiss Brad) No, I'm not</line>

<stage>Around the corner, Jeremy Colvin is on his skateboard, 
 observing the entire scene with Brad, Penny and the cops. He hesitates 
 at first but then rushes over to the two of them.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Shocked) HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Looking for you... all night - I thought you were hurt</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Getting up) I need to make sure the cops don't try to 
 plant anything</line>

<stage>With quiet fury in his eyes, Jeremy watches Brad leave.
</stage>
<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c03_trio.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> He's lucky there are cops around right now</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Flattered by the situation) Oh really?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Come on, we're going home</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> I'm not walking all that way</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> We'll take the bus</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Fun</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Don't you care about your family, have you even checked 
 on them?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Mom and dad are in Sacramento, they're fine</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Be grateful - the von Meers weren't as lucky</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Turning serious) Did something happen to fish lady?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Erika's dad died last night</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> NO WAY - that's horrible - I wonder if I should go over 
 to their house?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> You could... or you could continue to sit here in the 
 dirt, making out with dirt</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> It wasn't like you were around</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> I had to work two jobs and lay down some fresh tracks 
 last night!</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> As usual</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Do you want to break up, is that it?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Sighing) We'll discuss this later, let's go!</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Inside the Fiore farmhouse, everyone is gathered to comfort 
 an injured Anita and discuss last night's events.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Hanging up the phone) Craig's doctor wants to keep 
 him in the hospital for another day, just to be safe</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> I'll be sure to bring him some of my muffins later</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Biting her lip) Yeah, I'm sure he'll love your muffins</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> (Glowering at Anita) WE'LL go see Craig later - I still 
 can't imagine how you two were able to jump out of the copter in time</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Staring at her broken wrist in a cast) Luck, I guess</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> (Crossing herself) Not luck... the Lord!</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Sure, ma, whatever</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> (Sitting in a recliner and lighting up a cigarette) 
 Has the Coast Guard contacted you or Captain Phelps at all?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I have a meeting with them this afternoon - if Craig 
 is up to it, we'll do a teleconference</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> They better give you two a medal</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> MEDAL, HA - we'll be stunned if we aren't booted out 
 on our asses!</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> 'Nita - such language!</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Sorry, ma, but it's true - do you know how much those 
 birds cost? - and we toasted the most expensive one at our base</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> (Banging his cane down on the floor) IT WASN'T YOUR 
 FAULT - YOU HAD TERRORISTS TRYING TO KILL YOU</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I'm sure they'll find a way to make it our fault</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> Homeland security... BULLSHIT</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> Not you too, Francis!</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Looking out the window) Here we go again</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> WHAT? - I'm sorry for not being all PC like but it's 
 time to close the god damn borders and send everyone who shouldn't be 
 here packing!</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Didn't your relatives come her illegally?</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> That was a very long time ago and NOT THE POINT - times 
 have changed, the land of infinite wealth is long dead and forgive me 
 for not wanting to see my tax dollars spent on those who want to BLOW 
 UP MY DAUGHTER</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Smiling at her dad) Aww, thanks papi</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> Francis, PLEASE watch your blood pressure</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> Terrorists... is that really the conclusion the authorities 
 have come up with?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Pretty much</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> But it wasn't, was it?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I have no idea - I cannot even begin to explain what 
 I saw last night and I'm not sure I want to</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> (Extremely agitated) You should FORGET what you saw 
 last night, be happy that you are here with your family and concentrate 
 on healing yourself</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I need to concentrate on finding my bracelet - I think 
 I might have lost it at the hospital</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> (Looking away) Don't worry, I have it in a safe place</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Turning to face her mother) Where is it? - AYYY, bastard 
 rib!</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> (Jumping up) Let me go get you some fresh ice for 
 your bruises</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Will everyone stop it, por favor? - I'll be fine, really, 
 just let me be - I'm more worried about dad now that McBride has high-tailed 
 it out of town</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> There is no way they can come after him as a suspect</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Still staring out the window) Don't be so sure</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> Can we please deal with one family crisis at a time?</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> That reminds me, I need to make a casserole and bring 
 it over to the von Meers - KJ must be devastated</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> Right, poor KJ - he gets to inherit a fortune!</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> Don't be so mean, Javier - do you forget how you 
 felt when you lost your father?</line>

<stage>There is silence in the room.</stage>

<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> Remember that Erika is affected as well</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> I wonder if they were finally able to find her?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> She's missing?</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> KJ called three times asking if she was at the lab 
 last night</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Huh... that's odd - I still can't believe Old Man Karl 
 kicked it</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> I will stop by the church later and have a mass said 
 for him</line>

<stage>The phone rings in the kitchen and Ona Rosa answers it.</stage>

<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> Anita, it's for you!</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I don't want to talk to anyone</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> It's someone named Marcy Nolan?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Jumping off of the sofa) I'll take it in the other 
 room!</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> Oh, I almost forgot - Frank, while we were driving 
 up, we thought we saw the lights on in the old bunkhouse - are you doing 
 something down there?</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> No, I'm not - it must be those damn squatters again 
 - Carmie, bring me my 12 gauge!</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> NO, NO MORE GUNS - WE DO NOT NEED YOU IN ANOTHER MESS</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Holding up his hand) Stay seated, Frank, I'll go take 
 care of it!</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> Need some help?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> NO... thanks - I can handle it!</line>

<stage>Hector is out the door and on his way. Anita watches 
 him from the kitchen window.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (On the phone with Marcy) So, can you come over? - WHY? 
 - I'd really like you to be here for me now... that's a total excuse 
 - OK, you know what, NEVERMIND - when you decide to break away from 
 fantasy land and learn how to relate to REAL human beings instead of 
 characters on a stage, LET ME KNOW</line>

<stage>Anita bangs down the phone and sulks for a moment.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Heading out the side door) I better see if Uncle Hector 
 needs some help</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>At the von Meer estate, Erika sits silently in the living 
 room, itching at a tiny patch of scales under her fingers. She observes 
 the activities around her. Griffin speaks on a phone, Ben is in the 
 kitchen with Joe making lunch, Shelby is lighting candles and doing 
 some kind of ceremony with pineapples, Tim is speaking with concerned 
 neighbors and Kylee is doing a report for KCON in the front yard. Coming 
 from the master bedroom, KJ sluggishly ambles down the stairs with Dr. 
 Stephanie.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (To KJ) That should hold her for awhile</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Rubbing his bloodshot eyes) Thanks, Steph</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Keep an eye on your mom and I'll be by later 
 tonight to check in on her</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Going over to them) Is she going to be alright?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Steph had to tranq her up</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> She'll be fine, she just needed a little something 
 to calm her down</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I just don't understand how the hospital could make such 
 a stupid mistake - no one authorized dad... his body... for release</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I know - I'm on my way over there right now 
 to clear all of this up</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Trying not to cry) We need to say goodbye to him!</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Hugging KJ) I know, we'll figure it out, I 
 promise</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Kissing her on the cheek) Thanks Steph... ooh, I smell 
 Joe's soup - can I get you anything before you go?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> No thanks, Kage, you make sure you get some 
 rest!</line>

<stage>Erika watches her brother walk away and then shoots a 
 frosty glare at Stephanie.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Let me walk you to your car</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Putting her arm around Erika) How are you holding 
 up, Kiddo?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Remarkably well</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> That advice wasn't just for your brother - you 
 need some rest as well</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I realize that</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I noticed you itching earlier - it's probably 
 from nerves - I have some cream that will help</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Making sure they are out of everyone's view) Actually, 
 I need your help with another matter</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Anything, Sweetie</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Grabbing Stephanie by the neck and pinning her against 
 the side of the house) WHERE IS MY FATHER?</line>
