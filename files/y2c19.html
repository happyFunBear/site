<stage>With the shades drawn and the room darkened, Morrigan types away on her keyboard as the Cowboy Junkies &quot;Pale Sun, Crescent Moon&quot; CD plays softly in the background.</stage>

<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> i'm being watched, is that it?</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> It is a valid assumption</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> excuse me while i hold up half of a peace sign to the hidden cameras</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> We cannot risk meeting, at least not until I have my strength back</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> when will that b?</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> I am uncertain</line>

<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> If I can</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> r u Nunashish?</line>

<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> answer the question</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> No, there is nothing mystical about me, I am my own kind</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> as u have said b4 - what about The Clergy?</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> That, I cannot answer - they revealed themselves to me the night of the charity ball</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> no rumors about them before?</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> Only rumors, nothing solid</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> i saw Joenne Mirabello tonight</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> And?</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> the feds r salivating over the magic metal</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> That is not surprising</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> is this the only location for it?</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> In this country, yes - there are only two other sources in the world</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> where?</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> I cannot tell you now</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> this whole thing is insane</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> It is actually saner than you would believe it to be</line>
<line><actor><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></actor> whatever - i don't think she knows about u - the specifics, that is</line>
<line><actor><color="#006400">Anon1</color></actor> Try to keep it that way for as long as possible</line>

<stage>Overwhelmed with the need for sleep, Morrigan flips off her computer and barely makes it to her bed. She is out the minute she hits the pillow. Over the next hour, she is confronted with wild dreams. They include blurry images, muffled voices, symbols that don't make sense to her, and the last thing she feels is an overwhelming sense of coldness. She screams and opens her eyes. Standing at the foot of her bed is a naked Amethyst, wearing a solitary crystal around her neck.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Blank expression) You must come with me... NOW</line>

<stage>Inside the Duquesa Bay Yacht &amp; Polo Club's main dining room, Zach finishes touring the small dance floor with Justine. They wave to KJ having dinner with his parents and return to their table.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Sipping her drink) I must say, Zachary, I am very impressed - how did you ever get us in here?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Trying to figure out what kind of bread he's eating) A source owed me a favor</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> What's the occasion?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Can't I take a beautiful woman out for a decent meal?</line>

<stage>Justine sits in silence and raises an eyebrow.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Sighing) OK, OK, I need some info</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (To the waiter) Another shrimp cocktail, please!</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Sarcastic) Be sure to save some room for dessert</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Winking) Oh, not to worry, I will</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> So, now that you know my ulterior motive, can you please tell me about J...</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Father Greg? - or should I say Father Greg's parts?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Stunned) Um... right, yeah, go on</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Impressed with herself) Actually, you should be glad that I'm here to tell the tale at all - I was nearly caught by my boss - thank goodness he had to stop and chat with big boob receptionist because it gave me the extra seconds I needed to get the body back in storage and look all innocent</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Chuckling) Justi, you never look, &quot;all innocent&quot;</line>

<stage>Shooting a squinty-eyed glare at her dinner companion, Ms. Mirabello says nothing.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Retreating into his salad) Ahem... please continue</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> As I was saying, once I got the padre back all snug in the fridge, I made up a random excuse as to why I was leaving early and went directly to the SCU lab with some tissue samples - Shelby Willis helped me out with the testing</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Is it wise to get her involved with this?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I trust Shel, we belong to the same Weight Watchers group</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> And that automatically grants loyalty?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> It's the same kind of loyalty you have for your pool-playing buddies</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Wow, are you ever screwed!</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Bad example - how about this, we take tennis lessons from the lady sitting at the table to your left</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Craning his neck) Mrs. von Meer? - really?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Don't sound so shocked, I can do more than bowl, you know</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Taking her hand and kissing it) I know</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> So, now that we've established Shelby as a trusted source, do you want to hear about our findings?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Absolutely!</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> It turns out Father Gregory Porter is really &quot;Father John Doe&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> What do you mean?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Try to follow along, Newspaper Boy - here, I'll simplify it for you... he's NOT whom he CLAIMS to be</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> And whooom exactly would he be?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Good question! - I have no idea - the better questions are &quot;why does he have different body parts&quot; and &quot;how could he technically be over 200 years old?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Dropping his fork) WHAT?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Shhhh - we're in an exclusive club, a club I want to belong to someday, please behave appropriately</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Trying to find his voice) Those... those were some pretty powerful conclusions you came up with there, Justi, care to elaborate?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I know, and that's why Shelby and I went over them a half a dozen times and each time, the results were the same - this man, and I use the term lightly, has several different organs from several different people and yet they all worked harmoniously and without rejection... until...</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Until what?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I'm not sure - but the bullet was the least of his problems</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> How is this possible?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I wish I knew - but it gets even better... the bone sample we took, dates him at around 200 years of age</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Unreal!</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Exactly! - and, of course, my boss is sitting on all of this information, I don't know who he's involved with or what his deal is</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> You need to find out</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Eh, no - that's your job, I want to keep mine - why don't you ask Morrigan? - she's the epicenter of this weirdness, maybe she knows something about &quot;the man&quot; she shot?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I don't think she shot him</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Digging into her shrimp cocktail) Then, I don't want to find out who did</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Absently) Huh, and I just wanted to find out about Joenne</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Aghast) WHAT ABOUT JOENNE? - IS SHE INVOLVED WITH THIS?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Shhhh - remember, you want to get into this club?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THIS CLUB...</line>

<stage>Everyone turns around and looks.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT MY SISTER</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Justine</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> TELL ME, ZACH</line>

<stage>His cell phone starts to ring.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Answering it) Hold on... hello?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> It's me</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Where are you?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm on my way back to KCON - when I wiped Morri's machine, I left some dummy files as a decoy and installed a tracker program to signal me when someone tried to access them</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I'm on my way</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> NO, stick with Justine and try to find out some more info - I'll let you know as soon as I know something</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I'll be there in ten</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> ZACH</line>

<stage>Isaacson starts to leave the table.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> You are not going ANYWHERE until you finish about Joenne!</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> In the car, c'mon, HURRY</line>

<stage>KJ and his parents watch as Zach and Justine rush out of the room.</stage>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Picking at her entree) I swear, the element the club is attracting lately is cheapening it by the second</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Chewing) Whatever you say, mom</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> It's one thing for your sister to be antisocial and rude in a place like this but when commoners do it, that's just abysmal!</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Staring at his pasta) Erika is rarely in a place like this these days</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Commoners? - are we in a royal palace? - behold, ye thin body and golden tan, thou art truly a serf in queen's robes!</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Sweating) Son, please don't torment your mother with Elizabethan English at the diner table</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> I'd rather have him torment me with that instead of dating that troublemaker McBride</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Sighing) Here we go again</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> Look, Griffin tells me that Meeramar is on the verge of something big, you need all of your focus on that, NOT this girl's constant problems</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Dad can handle it</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Chugging his water glass empty) I want NOTHING to do with Martel's PCOC project, we need to keep Meeramar as far away from this mess as possible</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> THAT'S NONSENSE, KARL</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Why do you say that, dad?</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> BECAUSE... what he's... cough... getting into... wheeze... is going to... gasp... bring us all down</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Concerned) Karl?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Dad, are you alright?</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Losing the color in his face) I feel... very cold</line>

<stage>The elder von Meer slumps over into his dish.</stage>

<stage>Takanachi arrives at the station and sneaks in the side entrance. She cautiously approaches the darkened newsroom floor and makes her way towards Morrigan's cubicle. She hears a light tapping on a keyboard.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Peering around the corner) CLARK - WHAT IN THE HELL</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Jumping up) SHIT, GRACIE, YOU JUST GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Angry) WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MCBRIDE'S COMPUTER?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Forcing a smile) What are you doing here so late, G-sneak? - everyone's in studio</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> DON'T PULL ANY DIVERSIONARY BS AND ANSWER THE QUESTION</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Calmly) I'm just... I'm just trying to find something, that's all</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Folding her arms) And what exactly would that be?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> I don't need to answer to you, Fingers</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Do you want to answer to Gates?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Smirking) Is that a threat? - because if it is, I'm sure Turner would LOVE to find out who diddled around with this computer... and my money is on the one with the cute, squishy face standing before me</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Aghast) How... wh... SQUISHY? - why do you think it's me?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Casually glancing around) I don't see anyone else here, do you?</line>

<stage>Gracie sighs and tries to think of what to say.</stage>

<line><actor>Jason</actor> Look, if you must know, I'm trying to find out what story McBride was working on before she left - everyone here assumes it's a big one and everyone assumes that it's going to be passed along to Kylee if it hasn't already</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> That's not the only thing that's going to be passed along to Kylee</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> So, I figured I'd beat her and everyone else to the punch</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Why? - you're a sports reporter!</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> And that's exactly the reason - you think I want to be stuck shouting final scores the rest of my life? - I want to be a real journalist</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You do realize you're in broadcast, right?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> Yeah... does Eyes have a job for me at The Beacon?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Are you ready to live on peanuts and drive a Geo Prism?</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/y2c19_gracie_jason.jpg" h="555" w="620" border="0"></p>

<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Grimacing) Oooh</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You'll be a chick magnet for sure</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Flirtatious) As long as I attract one chick in particular, I'll be fine</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Blushing) HEY, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE MAD AT YOU</line>

<stage>For the first time, the two of them relax and chuckle.</stage>

<line><actor>Jason</actor> Seriously, I know I can do this and do a great job with it, I just need to break out of sports and this story will hopefully be my ticket</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Um, you do know that Morrigan is on the verge of being carted off to prison?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Genuinely remorseful) Yes... and I'm real sorry about that - she seems like a sweet girl and if there's anything I could do for her, I would, but I also have to think of my career and the too few opportunities that are out there, especially for people like us</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I know</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> I mean, Christ, no one is circulating out of these jobs anymore - no one can advance up as long as people like Henshaw and Steel have their asses parked there for eternity</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Heh, did you hear about that anchor in LA finally dropping at 80?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> See what I mean? - I know it's a harsh move to pull on McBride but the game goes on</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You could try doing what Shepperton does but I don't think Gates is your type</line>

<stage>Jason covers his face and gags. Gracie suddenly notices a cut on his upper wrist.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Jason... can I ask you something?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> Anything</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Truth?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Holding up his right hand) Word</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You've been sporting some rather nasty bruises and cuts lately - what is up with that?</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Short pause) You know I like to play hard - my pick-up games get brutal, no question</line>

<stage>As Gracie mulls over this response, the sound of the elevator interrupts.</stage>

<line><actor>Jason</actor> NOW WHO?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Dammit, we're both going to get our asses kicked for being here - quick, let's hide in Ortega's cube and peek out over his Diana Ross dolls</line>
<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Following her) Good idea</line>

<stage>Both are stunned to see a hooded figure float out of the elevator and head their way.</stage>

<line><actor>Jason</actor> (Whispering) Who in the hell is that?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> WHAT in the hell is that?</line>
