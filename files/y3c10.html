<h2>Circle Break</h2>

<stage>With a lifeless Morrigan in her arms, Darkfin stumbles 
 out of the river and falls to the bank. Mt. Wiggins continues to explode 
 in the distance.</stage>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c10_df_morri.jpg" h="406" w="560"></p>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> Come on, Morrigan, keep fighting</line>

<stage>Inside Morrigan's mind, she hears Darkfin's words but 
 cannot respond. She also hears the comforting tones of her mother's 
 ancient lullaby.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (In her mind) Mom - where are you?</line>

<stage>Meanwhile, a frantic Darkfin desperately searches Morrigan's 
 body for signs of life. No breath, no pulse, nothing.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> DO NOT LEAVE ME</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (In her mind) I'm here... I'm right here - feel me, 
 I know you can!</line>

<stage>Darkfin pounds her fist in anger on the ground. Taking 
 a deep breath, she continues to perform CPR on an eerily cold Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Choking with tears) NO, NO, NOT AGAIN - NOT LIKE 
 SAMMY</line>

<stage>Aleta Oscura spends several more minutes working in vain. 
 Sick and weakened herself, she crumples on top of McBride and begins 
 to sob uncontrollably.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (In her mind) DON'T GIVE UP, YOU KNOW I'M STILL WITH 
 YOU</line>

<stage>An odd calm washes over Darkfin as she pulls back from 
 the body. Suddenly, a wave of rage causes her to snatch the glowing 
 crystal off of Morrigan's neck.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Smashing it into shards) NO MORE</line>

<stage>The crystal pops and crackles as tiny flecks of light 
 dissipate into the air. Morrigan's eye fly open, they are glowing the 
 same orange color as the crystal, the same color her mother's eyes once 
 did. Her head and torso spring upright as she sucks in a huge, rattling 
 breath.</stage>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c10_morri_eyes.jpg" h="427" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> Morrigan?</line>

<stage>The Marked One is now on her feet. A primal shriek is 
 unleashed from her mouth as the ground shakes directly beneath them. 
 Paralyzed by multiple emotions, Darkfin can only watch as Morrigan demonically 
 wails and flails in the direction of the volcano.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Unearthly voice) NOW</line>

<stage>As quickly as it erupted, Mount Wiggins abruptly ceases 
 its pyrotechnics. Morrigan now turns to the river and raises her arm. 
 The trident comes flying out to meet her grasp. The weapon is now enshrouded 
 with the same orange glow. Darkfin is back on her heels in awe.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Timidly) Morrigan</line>

<stage>Still possessed, Morrigan's whole body reflects this 
 as veins bulge and her muscles tense. She whirls around and prepares 
 to plunge the trident directly into the heart of Darkfin.</stage>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c10_morri_trident.jpg" h="534" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Unafraid) Release!</line>

<stage>The sight of the Aleta Oscura briefly softens McBride. 
 She now whips around in the opposite direction and launches the trident 
 at the Kiyomi mountain range. It soars into the air, well past the river.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> It has subsided</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (A soft whisper) For now...</line>

<stage>She collapses to the ground, curls up into the fetal 
 position and slowly starts to rock. Unable to find words, Darkfin inches 
 over and touches her fingers with hers.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Grabbing her hand) Hold me... please</line>

<stage>Darkfin pulls Morrigan into a protective embrace and 
 the two stay on the ground, consoling each other in silence. Moments 
 pass.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Tell me about Sammy</line>

<stage>Darkfin jumps up and turns her back to Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> We have to go</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Where?</line>

<stage>Darkfin notices a helicopter on approach.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Away from here - come</line>

<stage>Morrigan struggles to her feet. She feels the scaly arms 
 of Darkfin wrap around her for support and the two start to walk.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> This is the second time you've saved me from that 
 river</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> And, hopefully, the last</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I can safely say that this time outdid the other 
 rescue, exploding train and all</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> I do not look forward to outdoing ourselves again</line>

<stage>Aleta Oscura doubles over and succumbs to a coughing 
 fit. She is gradually losing her color and her morph.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You don't look so good</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> When have I ever looked good?</line>

<stage>This remark causes both of them to smile.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> We need to reach higher ground</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> The lava and ash are flowing in the other direction</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Mount Wiggins is the least of my concerns - it is 
 too unpredictable out here in the open, we must find shelter</line>

<stage>The two tread along the hillsides of the Don Alessandros. 
 They go deeper into the trees for cover.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I heard them talking... they called me a &quot;Taint&quot;</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Keep moving</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> One of them couldn't believe the &quot;Marked One&quot; 
 would be a Taint - do you know what that means?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> We will discuss it later</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Later, later, later - what happens when later is 
 no longer an option?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Watch your step</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I'm so tired...</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> I know - we will find a place soon</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> No, I mean, yeah, I'm tired physically - but I'm 
 more tired mentally - I'm tired of all this intrigue and hocus pocus, 
 I'm tired of being a fugitive... I'm really tired of running around 
 naked</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> You look fine</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Do I?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Um... you can grab some leafy branches if it will 
 make you feel better</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Will it make you feel better?</line>

<stage>There is a noticeable pause.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> What will make me feel better is cold water... cold 
 salt water</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> It's one long walk to the ocean - I can barely see 
 as it is</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> No, we will not make it that far - there are cabins 
 ahead</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> How do you know?</line>

<stage>Darkfin is suddenly silent.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You have human friends, don't you?</line>

<stage>Darkfin does not respond.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Other friends besides me... why am I suddenly jealous 
 of that?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Do not be</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> But, then again, I'm not exactly human, am I?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Morrigan...</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Giddy) Neither are you - we're the perfect pair 
 of freaks - let's throw a party!</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Stop it...</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> We can play board games and serve turducken - of 
 course, that will all be contingent on whether the world blows up or 
 not</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Clutching her face) STOP... IT... NOW</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I love you</line>

<stage>Darkfin freezes on those words. The two stare at each 
 other for a long minute until they both back away in shock.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> That just kind of slipped out</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> You are under pressure</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Maybe... but it doesn't make it any less true - do 
 you love me?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Please do not ask me that now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> When? - LATER?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> We need to focus on what is happening now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I agree... that's why I said it</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> We should be nearing the cabins</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You love Sammy</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Agitated) She is no longer of this earth</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> But you still love her, you can hear the reverence 
 in your voice</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> And she lost her life because she knew too much</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I'm... I'm sorry</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Turning around) I cannot... I WILL not let that happen 
 to you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Moving closer) I honestly don't think either one 
 of us can stop what is inevitable</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> What do you know?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> A lot more than before</line>

<stage>Darkfin glances down at Morrigan's legs.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> You are bleeding</line>

<stage>Morrigan carefully wipes the corners of Darkfin's mouth 
 with her fingers.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> So are you</line>

<stage>A rustle in the bushes causes both of them to tense.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Stay behind me!</line>

<stage>Five snarling coyotes reveal themselves and surround 
 the two.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> I wish you had not thrown my trident so far</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You'd be dead right now if I didn't</line>

<stage>Darkfin is stunned by those words. With a swift, nonchalant 
 motion, Morrigan picks up a heavy stone and zeros in on the alpha animal. 
 It is brained before Darkfin can even process what is happening. The 
 others scamper away without a whimper.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> What has come over you?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I wish I knew... where did you say those cabins were 
 again?</line>

<stage>The two continue up a small trail in silence. It is now 
 Darkfin's turn to trail behind, growing weaker with each step.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Pointing) There... to the left</line>

<stage>A small A-frame nestled among a grove a trees comes into 
 view. An exuberant Morrigan practically carries Darkfin the remaining 
 steps as they make their way to the entrance.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> This is so cliche!</line>

<stage>Darkfin leans over the porch and vomits up squid bits.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Well, almost</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> I fail to see the humor in any of this right now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Can't you? - it's like being trapped in my very own 
 version of Days of Our Lives - or, better yet, a bad Sigma Seven marathon</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> When is Sigma Seven good?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> So, you DO watch TV</line>

<stage>Darkfin limps over and feebly tries to kick in the door.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> We need to get inside</line>

<stage>Morrigan is already fumbling around the mailbox and potted 
 plants. She finds a key hidden underneath the birdbath.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Jumping over) People are so predictable - open sesame!</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Turning the lock) Enough with the ebullience</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> It's weird, it's like I'm on some sort of sugar high 
 - look at what else I found...</line>

<stage>Morrigan proudly holds up a black feather and goes to 
 tickle Darkfin's nose with it. Darkfin falls to the ground with a seizure.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Running inside) Not good</line>

<stage>Morrigan hunts around for a blanket, finds one and rushes 
 it over to a twitching Darkfin.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Wait... she said she needed cold - cold water - salt 
 water</line>

<stage>Using the blanket as a sling, Morrigan hauls Darkfin 
 over to the bathroom and gingerly places her into the combo shower/tub.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Turning the faucet on full) I've seen hideous shower 
 curtains before but this one takes the cake - Gracie has been outdone</line>

<stage>The rush of cold water snaps Darkfin back to consciousness. 
 Her arm fins expand, ready to fight.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> WHOA, put those away - those aren't tub toys!</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> What... what happened?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You blacked out there for a minute</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Relaxing in the water) How did I get in here?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I asked the neighbor down the road to lift you in 
 - his name is Bill, he has a bulbous red nose</line>

<stage>Not realizing the joke, Darkfin panics and scans around 
 the cabin.</stage>

<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> FOOL</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> CALM DOWN... I'm kidding</line>

<stage>Darkfin slumps under the water and remains there as Morrigan 
 sits on the side of the tub.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I remember this time in second grade when I won a 
 goldfish at the school fair - I tried to hide him in the pool because 
 my dad didn't want any more pets...</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Popping her head up and gasping) SALT... I need salt</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> OK</line>

<stage>Morrigan runs to the kitchen and finds a half-empty saltshaker.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Returning) Will this do?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Dumping it into the water) It is not enough - use 
 canned soups if you have to</line>

<stage>This causes Morrigan to chuckle as she snatches two cans 
 of chicken broth from the cupboard.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> All I need is some cayenne pepper and you'll make 
 a fine jambalaya!</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> (Sighing) Why must you do that?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Do what?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Make light of everything?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Defense mechanism... why do you have to be such a 
 cold, terse bitch?</line>

<stage>Darkfin blinks at her.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Uh-huh - fish or no fish, you're a bitch!</line>

<stage>Darkfin grimaces in pain as the changes in her metabolism 
 continue.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> It has nothing to do... with you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Growing scared) You... you're not going to belly 
 up on me, are you?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> I should be fine</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I don't like &quot;should&quot; - could you change 
 that to &quot;will?&quot;</line>

<stage>Morrigan takes Darkfin's hand in hers and squeezes it.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> It's not like I can just flush you, you know</line>

<stage>They both smile at the comment.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Do you need more salt? - I think I saw a bag of potato 
 chips in there</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> No - there is nothing more to be done... GO</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> WHAT? - where?</line>
<line><actor> Darkfin</actor> Go to the other room and find some clothes - rest 
 - let me rest... in private</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> But...</line>

<stage>Before Morrigan can utter another word, Darkfin is out 
 of the tub, ushering Morrigan out the door, and locking it behind her.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> HEY... what if... what if you need oyster crackers?</line>

<stage>The sound of the running shower water is now heard as 
 a miffed Morrigan finds an ugly camo hunting shirt to slip on. She finds 
 some even uglier neck ties from the 70's in the closet.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Cleaning herself up) Maybe she'd let me stay if 
 I were hogtied and blindfolded? - nah... I've had way too much of that 
 with the hooded creeps</line>

<stage>McBride paces around the cabin, pulling the shades and 
 taking inventory.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> When Fin feels better, we need to put all our cards 
 on the table - everything, and I do mean everything, needs to be discussed!</line>

<stage>An bronze statue of an angry bird gawks at her from a 
 bookshelf.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What are you looking at? - huh, where have I seen 
 you before? - it would be so refreshing to see an actual smile for once</line>

<stage>Morrigan fetches herself a glass of water and studies 
 the liquid before gulping it down.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Hmmph - she isn't the only one hurting right now 
 - I'm hurting, real bad - is it asking too much for a just a little 
 solace, is it?</line>

<stage>A gleaming nail file comes into her view.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Looking at the bathroom door) Hmm</line>

<stage>With eager stealth, McBride takes the file and approaches 
 the bathroom door.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Muttering) Like it or not, people comfort each other 
 in times of crisis, not hide in separate rooms...</line>

<stage>Morrigan successfully picks the lock and opens the door.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Entering) Maybe you want to be a cold fish, literally, 
 but I...</line>

<stage>She is stunned to find a very human silhouette behind 
 the frosted shower curtain.</stage>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c10_shower.jpg" h="422" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> You ARE human!</line>
