<h2>&quot;Le Spa Duchesse&quot;</h2>


<stage>Finishing an intense work out at the Le Spa Duchesse gym, Lieutenant Anita Fiore treads into the locker room to change. She stops to chat up a few lady friends.</stage>


<p><img src="../graphics/v15_anita_lockerroom.jpg" width="570" height="521" border="0"></p>

<line><actor>Friend #1</actor> (Strutting past) Once again, Fiore, you spun us into the ground during class</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> What can I say, I had a lot of nervous energy that needed to be taken care of</line>
 <line><actor>Friend #2</actor> Don't we all</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Loco job duties, crazier family matters - it's enough to make me scream... and that's rare</line>
 <line><actor>Friend #1</actor> Heh, yeah</line>
 <line><actor>Friend #2</actor> What's the problem, your usual &quot;conduits&quot; not working for you?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Stripping off her clothes) They ALWAYS work for me... just not enough lately</line>
 <line><actor>Friend #1</actor> Aww, that's a real shame - so you had to take it out on innocent free weights</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Smirking) Unless you have another suggestion</line>
 <line><actor>Friend #1</actor> (Disappearing into the shower) NU-UH, not this time, I've had enough Fiore Frenzy to last me an eternity</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Wrapping herself in a towel) Sorry to hear that</line>
 <line><actor>Friend #2</actor> She finally grew a conscience</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Heading for the sauna) Good for her... you should try it sometime</line>
 <line><actor>Friend #2</actor> (Looking back and winking) Never!</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I'll keep that in mind!</line>
 
<stage>Now inside the steam room, Anita can barley see in front of her. She takes a seat on the wooden bench and feels something beneath her.</stage>
<line><actor>Marcy</actor> GET OFF OF MY HAND, FREAK</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> OH, I'M SO SORRY - I didn't realize... Marcy?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Waving away some of the steam from her face) Anita?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> WELL, Ms. Nolan, imagine running into you... AGAIN</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Hello, Lieutenant</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Are ya following me?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> OF COURSE, that's it, YOU just tried to sit on my fingers without buying me dinner first and I am the one that's following you - sure, let's go with that</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/v15_steam.jpg" width="620" height="532" border="0"></p>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> You're an actress, you should be able to go with anything</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> That's your rep, isn't it, Fiore?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> No, you see, I stick to one side of the playing field unlike certain others in this room... wait a minute... there ARE no others in the room... except you</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Let's just say I like to experience the bounty that is life</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Tell me, did you ever experience the bounty that was Jenny?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Excuse me?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> You know, your &quot;sister&quot; on the show</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Ah, a conversation about &quot;Life's Little Lessons&quot; - what a surprise</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Singing the theme song)</line>
 <stage>
 <blockquote>
 <p><i>From the bow to the stern<br>
 
 Every corner, there's a turn</i>
 </blockquote>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Please don't sing</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Louder)</line>
 <blockquote>
 <p><i>
 Play with fire, you'll get burned<br>
 
 Finally, one day, you will learn<br>
 
 Life's - Little - Lessons</i>
 </blockquote>
 </stage>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> And</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> LIFE'SLITTLELESSONS, OY</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Great, did you get that out of your system now?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> You didn't answer my initial question</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Yep, I made my way through all of them, does that satisfy your prurient interests?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Shocked) EVEN RABBI SAUL?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Nope, Rabbi Saul was a eunuch - the result of a very ugly golf cart accident</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> OY</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Stop saying that</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Sorry, it's just that I learned everything I know about Judaism from watching Rabbi Saul and the show</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> That's a sad commentary about the education of our American audience but remarkably true - um... you do know that he's not a real rabbi, right?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I always wondered</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> He's not even Jewish</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> WHAT?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Graham Dobbs, a classically trained English actor</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> NO FREAKING WAY</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> He made us all eat tripe one day as a prank</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Ooh, I don't want to hear anymore</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> So, you don't want to know about Rabbi Saul doing Widow Perkins behind the lighting trucks... before the accident that is?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> NOOO - you're shattering my childhood ideal!</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Well, I guess you don't want to hear about me doing &quot;Jenny&quot; on location in Japan then?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Come again?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Our first real introduction to sushi</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Seriously?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> We were old enough to share a hotel room - one night in Osaka, her hand went looking for the cookies but reached for the wrong jar</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Doing a little dance) I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Don't soil yourself, Lieutenant, EVERYONE knew it just by watching us - the producers knew it, the network suits knew it, even Snappy the one-eyed turtle knew it</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Aww, I loved Snappy!</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Total prop</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> AAAARRGH</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> On some sick level of total denial, our parents knew it as well - but no one was willing to admit it - the money was too good</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Legalized kiddie porn?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Maybe just a shade above it but I sure felt like I was being pimped</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Who knew that a sitcom about a rabbi taking care of five orphaned siblings in 1920's Toronto would be such a big hit?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Or a musical - don't forget that wonderful aspect!</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I'm amazed it lasted for ten years</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Nine years too many for me - my entire puberty was caught on film and I can relive the wonders of it in just about any country that has cable</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> That's kinda scary</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> YEAH, IT IS</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Back to &quot;Jenny?&quot;</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Right, back to SARA... her real name</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I know</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Just a reminder, we do have real names</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I'll make a note of it</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> The on-screen chemistry I had with Sara was even more intense off-screen - being the same age, we literally grew up together - two kids from opposite ends of the country enjoying fame and fortune and rampaging hormones...</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I thought you had this big romance going with that Olympic skier guy?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Bobby, yep, that was arranged by the producers - they also set up Sara with the mayor's son... she's married to him now with four kids</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Wow - so I guess it worked out?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> I guess you could say that</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Sorry</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Nah, it was mostly a teenage crush thing coupled with the fact that she was the only person in the whole world who knew exactly what I was going through - &quot;Jackie&quot; and &quot;Julie&quot; were too young and &quot;Johnny&quot; was too busy porking Widow Perkins when other crew members weren't</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> WIDOW PERKINS WAS A SLUT</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Slight laugh) Tell me about it!</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> You... um didn't, I mean...</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> ARE YOU KIDDING? - I have some standards</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Sighing) Good</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Playfully) Not for you, it isn't</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Hey</line>
 
<stage>The two chuckle and shift positions.</stage>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> So, are you going to do the reunion movie?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Not in this lifetime or the next</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> C'MON, YOU HAVE TO</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> No, I do not - I am done with the character of &quot;Jamie&quot; - I owe her nothing and I owe the audience nothing - in fact, they are the ones who owe me</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> You're being a total diva!</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Nope, it's called self-respect... what little of it I still managed to hang on to in this business</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Gimme a break, lady, your career revolves around &quot;B&quot; films and playing a freaking space frog - I highly doubt going back to the role that lined your pockets and made you famous is going to typecast someone who is on the other side of 25</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> You'll never understand</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Do a better job of convincing me</line>
 
<stage>One of the spa attendants pokes her head in the door.</stage>
<line><actor>Attendant</actor> Jamie... I'm so sorry, I meant Ms. Nolan, it's time for your milk bath and mud mask</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Getting up and glaring at Anita) Thanks</line>
 <line><actor>Attendant</actor> It's just that I think of you as Jamie</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> I understand</line>
 <line><actor>Attendant</actor> Maybe I could get an autograph from you after the bath... it's for my little sister of course</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Walking out the door) Of course</line>
 
<stage>Now relaxing in a private room, submerged in a milk bath with a mud mask covering her face and cucumber slices over her eyes, Marcy takes in the soothing scents of aromatherapy while listening to smooth jazz over the sound system.</stage>


<p><img src="../graphics/v15_marcy_bath.jpg" width="520" height="466" border="0"></p>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (In a robe and closing the door behind her) I can't believe you listen to this crap</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Not moving) I like this crap - why are you in here, Lieutenant, this is a private room?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Taking a seat next to the tub) I came in here to apologize - I guess I can see how being Jamie has a few drawbacks</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Mmm - apology accepted</line>
 
<stage>Anita lingers and says nothing.</stage>
<line><actor>Marcy</actor> Is that it?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Getting up to leave) Enjoy the rest of your rest</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Taking the slices off of her eyes) Anita, wait...</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> What?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> I... I like talking with you - stay... if you'd like</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Returning to the side of the tub) Alright</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Tell me about yourself - your job, family</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Actually, I came here today to forget about my job and family - I hope you don't mind</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> I understand - so, what should we talk about?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) Do we have to talk?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Heh, yes, for now we do</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> OK</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> We can switch back to talking about me - actors are incredibly self-involved, we have to be</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I think I've met my match!</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> We'll see about that</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I have a question for you</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Go ahead</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Folding her arms) Why Ned?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Why not Ned?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Is he what you want in bed</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Some of the time</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Flake</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Flake, coward, whore... I've heard it all before - but it doesn't change the fact that I like doing it with guys - I just happen to like doing it with girls as well</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Why can't you decide?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Why should I have to? - have you ever been with a man?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Adamant) Never</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Ever have the urge to?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (More adamant) Never</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> See, you're a lesbian and I respect that - I wish you could show me the same respect</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I respect those who know who they are</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> I know exactly who I am - I am a bisexual and that's a huge difference, I value the person, not the body part</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> (Standing up) Oh yeah? - I can guess which part on Ned you value the most</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> It's more than that - I might give off a strong masculine vibe, but I really do like pink roses and lace curtains... along with the hockey and the sports cars - I just find a man who likes to cook and do the laundry, it's a nice yin yang balance</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> And the part of you staring inside my robe opening, what part of the equation does that balance out to?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> It's called enjoying the view</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Do you love him?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> I do</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> Then why am I wasting my time here?</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Do you consider it a waste?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> I like friendly chatter as much as the next person but when I'm right next to a beautiful woman in a milk bath and nothing is going to come of it besides more talking, yeah, I do consider it a waste of my time</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Who is to say nothing will come of it?</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> You just said earlier that...</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> Not here - you think I would be stupid enough to risk doing it in a public place? - I may be playing a space frog to you but I happen to love my job</line>
 
<stage>Growing frustrated, Anita stomps about the room.</stage>
<line><actor>Marcy</actor> Show some patience, Fiore... and some brains</line>
 
<stage>Marcy slowly gets out of the tub with Anita watching appreciatively.</stage>
<line><actor>Marcy</actor> Don't just stand there like a moron, gimme your robe!</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> There's another one hanging on the door, get it yourself</line>
 <line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Untying Anita's belt) I want yours</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/v15_anita_shower.jpg" width="470" height="538" border="0"></p>


<stage>Lieutenant Fiore finally complies. Now standing there naked, she helps a grinning Ms. Nolan into the robe and then quickly heads out for the showers. Anita spends about fifteen minutes under the streams of cold water, trying to process the discussion, when a fully-dressed Marcy pokes her head in past the thin plastic curtain.</stage>
<line><actor>Marcy</actor> (Taking a long look and then in a low voice) Next Tuesday night at the Quartz Lake Inn... if you think you can handle it</line>
 <line><actor>Anita</actor> We'll see if you can</line>
