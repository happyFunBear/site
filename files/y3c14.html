<h2>Treaty of Her Sigh</h2>

<stage>Still woozy from being knocked out by Erika, Tim slowly 
 opens his eyes to see the same three deputies from Eddington County 
 looming above him on the front porch.</stage>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c14_tim.jpg" h="427" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Tim</actor> Wh&mdash;where?</line>
<line><actor> Older Deputy</actor> Well, well, well &mdash; it's Mr. Hagidgin!</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Startled) What did you do to me?</line>
<line><actor> Older Deputy</actor> We haven't done anything&mdash; yet</line>
<line><actor> Younger Deputy</actor> But I'm sure your girlfriend has done plenty</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Nearly choking on the words) GIRLFRIEND?</line>
<line><actor> Other Deputy</actor> Ray's stick can attest to that</line>

<stage>The two men snicker and high five each other.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> Why am I in a robe on my porch?</line>
<line><actor> Younger Deputy</actor> She's a real kinky one, you lucky bastard</line>
<line><actor> Older Deputy</actor> You know, I could have you arrested for not following 
 my orders earlier</line>
<line><actor> Other Deputy</actor> Let's cut the guy some slack, I'd do the same 
 if I had a hot blonde like that waiting for me</line>
<line><actor> Younger Deputy</actor> Especially since, well, since you don't seem 
 to be her type</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> Hot blonde? &mdash; WOMAN? &mdash; um, no, this is all 
 wrong</line>
<line><actor> Older Deputy</actor> Maybe you can enlighten us?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> This is my brother Geoffrey Hajanian's cabin &mdash; you 
 can call him and check &mdash; you can look at my license again and 
 verify my name&mdash;</line>

<stage>Tim reaches for his wallet and realizes he has nothing 
 except the robe.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> No way&mdash;</line>

<stage>He runs over to the cabin door and it's locked.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Banging on it) MY KEYS</line>
<line><actor> Younger Deputy</actor> (Whispering to Tim) Is this some kind of role 
 playing thing? &mdash; think she'd be into a gang bang? &mdash; we already 
 have the uniforms</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> YOU NEED TO STEP AWAY FROM ME, NOW</line>
<line><actor> Older Deputy</actor> I'm getting tired of this, boys &mdash; I say 
 we take him in&mdash; exactly the way he is</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> WHO THE HELL IS THIS BITCH?</line>

<stage>Tim suddenly freezes up.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> Blonde you say?</line>
<line><actor> Other Deputy</actor> Does she wear wigs?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Ignoring him) Erika&mdash; could it possibly be? &mdash; 
 why?</line>

<stage>The shed in back of the cabin catches Tim's eye.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> OH MY GOD, SHE HAS MY BAG</line>
<line><actor> Younger Deputy</actor> (Excited) What's in the bag?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Slamming his fist on the door) DAMMIT ALL</line>
<line><actor> Older Deputy</actor> I'm done with this, cuff him and bring him to 
 the station!</line>

<stage>Before Tim can protest, the other deputy has him in custody 
 and his pushing him towards their car.</stage>

<line><actor> Younger Deputy</actor> What about his girl?</line>
<line><actor> Older Deputy</actor> I'll let you stay here for awhile and &quot;play&quot; 
 but bring her down when you're done</line>
<line><actor> Younger Deputy</actor> Awesome!</line>
<line><actor> Other Deputy</actor> Why does he get to have all the fun?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Muttering) I really hope it's you, Erika&mdash; or maybe 
 not</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Erika and Morrigan speed along the Santa Conchita riverbank 
 in Tim's Jeep. The soot in the air from the eruption creates a brilliant 
 orange sunset swirled with purple clouds.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Appreciative) Beautiful</line>

<stage>Erika smiles beneath her balaclava.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> It is nice to know you will always find the beauty, 
 no matter the situation</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Raises an eyebrow at her) Or person</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Perhaps &quot;creature&quot; is more appropriate</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Perhaps &quot;human&quot; is</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We are almost there</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I would feel better if you came with me</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I will return for you but there are matters that need 
 taking care of</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I know, you need to revert or morph or whatever it 
 is you do to become a Sea Monkey</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> The proper term is transmogrification</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Didn't I mention earlier how I forgot to pay attention 
 in biology?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I seem to recall that</line>

<stage>The Jeep slows and pulls off into an oak grove.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> You will have to walk it the rest of the way, you are 
 only about a quarter mile from your home</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Stepping out of the jeep) HOUSE&mdash; that place 
 was never really a home, now more than ever</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> But it is the safest place for you right now</line>

<stage>Erika motions to Tim's black bag.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Be sure to take it with you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> NUH-UH, I do NOT need that added worry</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It might be useful</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Then you use it, not me</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Fine, we have no time to argue</line>

<stage>Erika starts to get out of the jeep.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What are you doing?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Walking you to your door</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> This has been a really wild date but you don't have 
 to walk with me</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I want to make sure&mdash;</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> NO &mdash; I said I'll be fine!</line>

<stage>Erika is a little stunned.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Just like the president and the vice president are 
 rarely in the same room, it's better this way&mdash; in case something 
 should happen to one of us</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We will be fine but you are correct in playing it safe</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Moving closer to Erika) Besides, the quicker you 
 do what needs to be done, the quicker you come back to me</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Agreed &mdash; I need to find the trident and then I'll 
 return to the bay &mdash; expect me in the morning</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Do you want chicken eggs or salmon eggs?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I want you to relax and try to remember as much as you 
 can about what happened with The Clergy</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I wish I could forget</line>

<stage>Erika places a comforting arm around Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Amethyst is no threat to you&mdash; when she returns, 
 ask her about her father</line>

<stage>Morrigan grabs Erika's arm and gently feels it.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Sweet smile) Fin has skin&mdash; who knew?</line>

<stage>Erika can't find the words as Morrigan starts to walk 
 off.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> We still need to talk more&mdash; later</line>
<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c14_erika.jpg" h="469" w="540"></p>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Heavy Metal</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Halting) What?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You asked me before what my favorite kind of music was&mdash; 
 I enjoyed heavy metal at one time</line>

<stage>Erika hops back in the jeep and takes off.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Watching) Why did I think it would be Yanni?</line>

<stage>Miles down the road, Erika grabs the satellite phone 
 and dials.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Speaking French) Connect me to the Meeramar Zurich 
 office please&mdash; hello, Chantal, this is Erika &mdash; yes, I am 
 fine, thank you - I need you to convey a message to my brother&mdash;</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>KJ and Griffin speed through the mountains in a limo. 
 Griffin is chattering away on his satellite phone as a bleary-eyed KJ 
 slumps in his seat and tries to collect his thoughts.</stage>

<line><actor> Griffin</actor> (Into phone) Yes, father &mdash; I understand &mdash; 
 we'll be there shortly</line>

<stage>Griffin clicks off the phone and pours KJ and himself 
 a brandy.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Refusing it) I couldn't be anymore numb and still function</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> I just need you to function for a few more hours</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Care to explain to me why we're headed in the direction 
 of the volcano?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> We need to be there</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Okaaay</line>

<stage>KJ leans forward and taps on the window partition.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> Driver, turn around and take me back to Duquesa Bay</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> What are you doing? &mdash; DRIVER, IGNORE MR. VON 
 MEER'S REQUEST</line>

<stage>KJ lunges at Griffin and grabs him in a headlock.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> DRIVER, DO AS I SAY &mdash; I HAVE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH 
 OF YOU, GRIF &mdash; I NEED TO GO HOME TO MOM, WHO COULD VERY WELL BE 
 THE LAST OF MY FAMILY, AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY TO TELL ME 
 WHERE WE'RE GOING</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> (Gasping) I'LL TELL YOU, I'LL TELL YOU&mdash; LET 
 GO</line>

<stage>KJ does as Griffin coughs and regains his breath.</stage>

<line><actor> Griffin</actor> God almighty, you're as bad as your sister</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? &mdash; I SWEAR, IF YOU HURT HER&mdash;</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Bad choice of words, sorry &mdash; for the last time, 
 I love Erika more than my own life, I could never hurt her</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Looking out the window) Then&mdash; where is she?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> (Patting his shoulder) We'll find her &mdash; I promise 
 &mdash; but we need to attend this meeting, first</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Attend WHAT meeting? &mdash; for the last time, Griffin, 
 where in the hell are we going and why?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Remember what I told you about the Nereidium?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Is that what this is for? &mdash; we're on a wild goose 
 chase for your magic rocks?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Actually, Kage, it's metal&mdash;</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Rubbing his face) Aw, gimme a break!</line>

<stage>Griffin's satellite phone rings and he answers it.</stage>

<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Why, yes&mdash; yes, he's right here, hold on</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Taking the phone) Who is it?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Chantal from Zurich</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> That's odd&mdash; hello, Chantal</line>

<stage>KJ nearly leaps out of his seat.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> WHERE IS SHE?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> WHAT?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> ERIKA JUST SPOKE TO HER</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> WHERE DID SHE CALL FROM?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> HOLD ON, HOLD ON&mdash; did she say anything else?</line>

<stage>The limo enters a tunnel and the reception fades out.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> HELLO, HELLO? &mdash; CHANTAL? &mdash; DAMMIT, GET OUT 
 OF THE TUNNEL</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> We can't&mdash;</line>

<stage>The limo continues on and then slows down as darkness 
 envelopes it.</stage>

<line><actor> Griffin</actor> We're here</line>

<stage>The glowing eyes of several hooded figures approach the 
 limo windows.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>With twilight fading over the woods near Mount Wiggins, 
 Joenne Mirabello and her black ops unit patrol the area. Charred trees, 
 rocks and bodies litter the ground. She reverently touches the battle 
 fatigue tatters on a half skeleton/half corpse.</stage>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c14_joenne.jpg" h="569" w="460"></p>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Into her radio) Looks like we've found Major Dawkins</line>

<stage>One of her field agents points out an empty blue cloak 
 hanging from a tree.</stage>

<line><actor> Agent</actor> I wonder if that belonged to the bastard that got him?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> Bag it, we need everything we can get from these freaks</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> At least we got a few of them this time</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Kicking a tree stump) Yeah, and we lost 27 of us in 
 the process</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> DC is expecting a report soon</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> Send the same one we've been sending all along &mdash; 
 The Clergy is getting closer to the Nereidium and we're still fucking 
 helpless against them!</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> Do you want me to use those exact words?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> Be creative&mdash; and then go sweep the northern sector 
 &mdash; report back in ten minutes</line>

<stage>Joenne ventures down to a grove near the banks of the 
 Santa Conchita River. She scans the area with her own eyes and then 
 with inferred goggles. Nothing. As she begins to leave, a sensor gauge 
 lets out a single ping.</stage>

<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Freezing) Hello!</line>

<stage>She grabs her side arm and turns in the direction of 
 the reading. The pings grow louder and more frequent as she trots along.</stage>

<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Into her radio) ALL TEAMS, NEED ASSISTANCE AT ONCE, 
 LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES A STRAGGLER</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> (Over the radio) ON OUR WAY</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> THE TARGET IS STATIONARY AND AT THE FOLLOWING COORDINATES&mdash;</line>

<stage>Joenne is now running full bore. She snaps a green chemical 
 lightstick as darkness falls.</stage>

<line><actor> Joenne</actor> I'M COMING FOR YOU, HOOD BOY</line>

<stage>As she rounds an outcropping, she is amazed by the sight 
 of Darkfin's trident embedded in a rock with the body of a brown-robbed 
 Clergy member stuck beneath its prongs.</stage>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c14_clergy.jpg" h="428" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> HOLY SHIT</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> (Over the radio) AGENT MIRABELLO, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?</line>

<stage>The trident now glows a soft orange, causing Joenne's 
 lightstick to match its color.</stage>

<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Half smile) Well now, where's your Mama?</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> COME IN, JOENNE, DO YOU COPY?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Into her radio) I'M FINE &mdash; IT WAS A FALSE READING 
 &mdash; CANCEL THE BACKUP, REPEAT, CANCEL THE BACKUP</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> In that case, we could use your help over here &mdash; 
 we've spotted a civilian vehicle approaching on a fire road</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> Is it the Jeep we spotted earlier?</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> Negative &mdash; it's press&mdash; a KCON newsvan</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> Aw, great!</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> The Jeep went in the opposite direction but this is 
 coming straight at us &mdash; we need your order to fire&mdash;</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> HOLD ON, I MIGHT KNOW THESE PEOPLE</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> You know our directive about the media &mdash; we can't 
 let them get any closer!</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> HOLD YOUR FIRE UNTIL I CHECK IT OUT FOR MYSELF, THAT'S 
 AN ORDER</line>

<stage>Joenne casts a regretful look at the trident and then 
 runs off. She now approaches her fellow agent armed with an RPG launcher. 
 The KCON newsvan is in the crosshairs.</stage>

<line><actor> Agent</actor> We cannot take the risk of them broadcasting any of 
 this &mdash; we need to eliminate them ASAP, chalk up the disappearance 
 to the volcano</line>

<stage>Joenne takes a deep breath knowing there is no other 
 choice.</stage>

<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Bowing her head) Wait for them to cross the grove, 
 then fire</line>

<stage>The van suddenly halts and cuts the motor. The driver's 
 door opens.</stage>

<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Looking through her scope) Wait&mdash; who is that?</line>

<stage>A woman runs in their direction and yells.</stage>

<line><actor> Justine</actor> JOENNE, JOENNE, ARE YOU AROUND HERE?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> JUSTINE</line>
<line><actor> Agent</actor> FIRE</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Tackling the agent) NO, THAT'S MY SISTER</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Morrigan slips under the yellow police tape and sneaks 
 up to the back door of her darkened home. She takes a spare key from 
 under a loose roof tile and carefully goes inside. Making sure the window 
 shades are drawn, she checks each room and grabs a bottle of water from 
 the refrigerator.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Whispering) I'm starting to feel hot and cold again&mdash; 
 this is not good</line>

<stage>A thought crosses her mind, causing her to spit water.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Tallulah</line>

<stage>Morrigan hurries into her bedroom. She lights a tiny 
 candle and peers through the glass of the terrarium at her pet tarantula. 
 She lets out a huge sigh of relief when she realizes the spider is still 
 alive. The candle blows out as quick gust of air rushes from behind.</stage>

<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> Don't worry, I took good care of her for you</line>
<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c14_morri_scared.jpg" h="468" w="552"> </p>
