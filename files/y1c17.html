<stage>Inside a suite at the Quartz Lake Inn, Kylee Shepperton finishes her morning shower and casually wraps a mauve towel around her. Checking the clock on the nightstand, she crawls over the rumpled, queen-sized bed and grabs her ringing pink cell phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Hello? - oh, hi momma - no, I'm not busy, Turner just left - it's fine, really... yes, I know - the deposit should be in the bank by this afternoon, check it then - how's Step-daddy #3? - good, good... NO, I told you I do not want to discuss him EVER, do you understand that? - look, I don't care - no, he is dead to me and has been for some time... he should be dead to you, too</line>
 
<stage>
 
 Three sharp knocks are heard at the door.</stage>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Listen, a real man is here, I need to go - love you too... ENTER</line>
 
<stage>
 Dressed in a golf sweater and wearing an impish grin, Griffin Martel does as he is told.</stage>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Was that a request or a command?</line>
 <line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Undoing the towel) Whatever makes you come quicker</line>
 
<stage>
 The middle Martel brother chuckles and starts to undress.</stage>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> I saw your girlfriend downstairs playing chess with Big Joe</line>
 <line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Going over to the bed) I don't feel like playing chess</line>
 <line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Going over to Griffin) Good</line>

<stage>
 Enjoying breakfast on the Quartz Lake Inn clubhouse patio, Benjamin Martel, his wife Claudia Steel and his sister Victoria Martel get ready for a round of golf.</stage>
<p><img src="../graphics/y1c17_juice.gif" width="121" height="251" border="0" align="right"><b>Claudia</b>: (Taking a sip of orange juice) UGH</p>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> What's wrong, Honey? - is it rancid?</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> There's no vodka in here</line>
 
<stage>
 Victoria reaches into her handbag, pulls out a silver flask and pours some of the contents into Claudia's glass.</stage>
<line><actor>Claudia</actor> (Mock smile) Thanks, Sis!</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> Hey, I'm just trying to up my chances on the course today</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Then you'll need to dump the whole thing in there</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> (Looking at his gold watch) None of us will have to worry about our games today if Griffin doesn't hurry up</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> It's not like Griff to be late, that's usually &quot;Brad behavior&quot;</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> By the way, I spoke to mom last night, he's staying with her again</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> (Chomping on a piece of toast) When is that woman ever going to learn?</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> (Lighting up a cigarette) She should have tied her tubes after you two</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> (Kissing his wife on the cheek) That's sweet</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> (Gagging on her bacon) I'll tell you one thing, I am through pulling strings for Brad at the courthouse - the next time he's in trouble, he's on his own!</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> You can tell that to mom</line>
 
<stage>
 Staring up at the floor of private suites, Claudia shades her eyes and squints.</stage>
<line><actor>Claudia</actor> Smiley, let me see your rangefinder for a moment</line>
 
<stage>
 Reaching into his golf bag, Dr. Martel hands his wife the instrument.</stage>
<line><actor>Claudia</actor> (Peering through it and smirking) Now I know why we're going to be late for our tee time</line>
 
<stage>
 She hands it over to her husband and directs him to the appropriate window.</stage>
<line><actor>Benjamin</actor> Oh wow</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> What, WHAT?</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Seems your brother is getting it on with K-CUNT</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> Who?</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> (Still watching) It's her pet name for Kylee Shepperton</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> Still threatened by her, eh Claw?</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> That two-bit southern-fried whore DOES NOT threaten me - I am the most adored KCON anchorwoman in its history and one of the most respected in the western United States</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> (Buttering a muffin) And that's why you run to get facelifts every other month to stay on the air</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Look, you fat cow, maybe if you put the pastries down, you'd finally get a real date instead of paying your bailiff to play handcuffs</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> (Popping a strawberry in his mouth) Ladies, ladies, please!</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> It just pisses me off that Kylee uses her pussy instead of her brains to get ahead</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> If I were you, I'd be more worried about that new girl, Morgan</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> MCBRIDE? - please, no one can even pronounce her first name right</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> She seems to be the center of attention lately</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> That's just dumb luck</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> Or good fortune</line>
 <p><img src="../graphics/y1c17_clubs.gif" width="93" height="150" border="0" align="right"><b>Claudia</b>: (Lighting up another cigarette) She's a nice girl and does nice work but she doesn't have the ambition to sit in my anchor chair</p>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> &quot;Ambition&quot; or a backstabbing, leg-spreading demeanor?</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> She's not Kylee, that's for sure - she's very cute but not sexy like me or Shepperton - the network wants sex, not the girl next door... no matter how many crazy stories she stumbles upon</line>
 
<stage>
 The clock tower chimes 8:00 am.</stage>
<line><actor>Claudia</actor> DAMMIT, GRIFFIN</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> (Throwing down her napkin) This blows!</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> (Still watching through the rangefinder) Literally</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> (Snatching the instrument from his hands) Go on up there and tell your brother to move his ass</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> (Getting up) Literally</line>
 
<stage>
 The only Martel daughter takes the rangefinder and starts to look as Claudia finishes the last of her orange juice.</stage>
<line><actor>Victoria</actor> OH MY GOD</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Yes, Shepperton is quite the gymnast</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> NO, LOOK - IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> (Doing so) OOH - well, now we know how Georgie is staying in shape - that Arab man seems familiar</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> He's not Arab, he's Armenian... I'm pretty sure that's Tim Hajanian from SCU</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Funny, I don't remember Greco-Roman Wrestling on the list of sports here</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> Poor Lydia</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Poor Lydia? - POOR GEORGE, having to resort to balding boy toys for a little fun</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> C'mon, how can you say that?</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> No man wants to deal with a crippled wife</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> He knew about her illness before they were married</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> And she knew about him as well - she wanted a husband and a child so bad, she was willing to take on a queer</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> Do you really believe that?</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> It's not a belief, it's a fact - she got her &quot;white picket fence&quot; and he got a pretty political fa&ccedil;ade to hide behind</line>
 
<stage>
 Victoria considers this as she drinks her coffee.</stage>
<line><actor>Claudia</actor> Of course, she probably believed the &quot;Magic Straight Fairy&quot; would change him, make her healthy and bear them a child... instead, he humps men in park bathrooms, she hobbles around on crutches, and they end up with an adopted freak baby</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> There is NOTHING wrong with Penny, she's a good, caring girl and smarter than you'll ever be</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Right, that's why she has a pierced tongue and barely passes her classes</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> And your kids are doing oh-so-well</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> At least I had them - what amazes me is that Lydia still has her job at the museum after the ball fiasco</line>
 <line><actor>Victoria</actor> It wasn't her fault</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> No, but she should've been better prepared - if it were an able-bodied person in that position, they wouldn't hesitate in showing her the door</line>
 
<stage>
 Benjamin returns with his sheepish-looking brother in tow.</stage>
<line><actor>Victoria</actor> THANK GOD, spare me from another second of Claw's conceited musings</line>
 <line><actor>Griffin</actor> I apologize for being late</line>
 <line><actor>Claudia</actor> Don't you mean &quot;for being laid?&quot;</line>
 <line><actor>Griffin</actor> Good morning, Claudia, so good to see you</line>
 <line><actor>Benjamin</actor> (Slinging his golf bag over his shoulder) Let's go, ladies</line>

<stage>
 Inside the plush lobby of the Quartz Lake Inn, Erika engages the owner, &quot;Big Joe&quot; Tiszo, in a game of chess.</stage>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Your move, Vihar</line>
 <p><img src="../graphics/y1c17_chess.gif" width="300" height="167" border="0" align="right"><b>Erika</b>: (Staring out the window) Huh? - oh, right</p>
 
<stage>
 The von Meer daughter casually moves her knight.</stage>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> What concerns do you have?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> What do you mean?</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> (Swiftly moving his piece) Checkmate</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> (Stunned) I didn't even see that</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Obviously - there is a greater challenge going on in your mind... what has you in this altered state?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> (Stirring her licorice spice tea) Nothing I can't handle</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Does Griffin being here with Ms. Shepperton upset you?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> (Spotting the Martels on the golf course) I didn't even know he was here... so, Riff is screwing Kylee again - I would think he'd be tired of his uncle's leftovers</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> (Taking a bite of his apple pancakes) Turner was just with her before Griffin arrived</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) There's nothing like keeping the STD all in the family</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Are you jealous?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> Are you joking? - I am THRILLED - hopefully, he'll leave me alone now</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Erika, do you really mean that?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> Seriously, Joe - I do not have the time or the need for a relationship right now - Griffin has been and always will be a part of my life but not in that way</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Then what has you so bothered?</line>
 
<stage>
 Erika simply glowers at him and thinks to herself.</stage>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Or should I say whom?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> Say nothing and watch me drink my tea</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> So, I'm right, it is a person?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> Maybe... maybe more than one</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Now, you are getting too kinky for me</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> Heh, this from a man who left the priesthood for a Parisian prostitute?</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Ha, checkmate - you finally won today!</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> Josef... have you ever played against an opponent whose strategy and motivation were completely foreign to you and, no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't figure it out?</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Hmph, I have indeed been served my badly bruised ass on a platter more than once - it is not a joyful experience</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> What did you do?</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Learned</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> That was deep... and hackneyed - what did you really do?</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Kicked back</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> TISZO, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Not today, you're not - you can't even beat me in chess</line>
 
<stage>
 Erika looks down at her tea.</stage>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Taking her hand and patting it) Look, Vihar, unless you can tell me specifics, I cannot give you any useful advice - it's not as if I can say &quot;use this type of wrench&quot; or &quot;buy this brand of wine&quot;</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> (Half smile) I know</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> You still aren't going to tell me, are you?</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> No</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> Argh</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> Thanks for listening, though - how about another game, this time I promise to concentrate</line>
 <line><actor>Joe</actor> (Wiping his mouth) Sorry, I have to get ready for a fencing match later this morning - a new opponent - let's hope I can figure out her strategy and motivation quickly</line>
 <line><actor>Erika</actor> (Winking) And what's your strategy and motivation, you old stud?</line>
 
<stage>
 As the two snicker, both of them look up and notice the TV over the bar where Morrigan flashes on the screen with a typical morning news update. Erika and Joe are momentarily silenced by her image.</stage>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Ah, and there is my pretty new opponent now</line>
