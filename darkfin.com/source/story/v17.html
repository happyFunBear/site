<stage>Trying to enjoy their lunch at Jean Louis' by the Watergate Hotel, Lydia and Penelope Renselier speak with a prominent &quot;Beltway&quot; socialite.</stage>

<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> Lydia, I can't tell you how much my husband is looking forward to having George step up with the real power elite</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Under her breath) A step up or a kneel down?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Casting her daughter a harsh glance) Why, thank you, CeCe - George absolutely adores the Senator and is looking forward to their golf game</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Munching on some flat bread) Actually, he's really looking forward to the locker room</line>
<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> (Sipping her tea) I'm sorry, dear?</line>

<stage>Lydia knocks Penny under the table with her crutch.</stage>

<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Saccharine smile) I do hope they have a smashing match today!</line>
<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> I need to correct you, Penelope - it's referred to as a ROUND of golf, not a match</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> OH... ROUND... as in your LARGE, ROUND ASUMPH</line>

<stage>Lydia quickly stuffs a scone in her daughter's mouth.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> So, CeCe, tell me more about your work with the Smithsonian?</line>
<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> I'd love to, but first, I need to take a quick trip to the ladies' room - if you'll both excuse me</line>

<stage>The two Renselier ladies watch the older woman flit across the room. Penny hurls something after her.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Grabbing her hand) Penelope... do not use the pecans from your muffin as projectiles - either you eat them or set them daintily aside on your plate</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Huffing and folding her arms) At least give me her teacup so I can drool in it</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Winking) Sorry, Honey, that's my department</line>

<stage>This elicits a slight laugh from her daughter.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> It won't be much longer, we just have some museum business to chat about and then we'll go meet your father</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> Did you hear what she said about my hair?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Well, whatever did you expect? - you have red, white, and blue streaks in it - you look like Betsy Ross' nightmare!</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> I was doing it to honor my father</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> And he appreciates your attempt at patriotism, Sweetie, but, next time - how about wearing a simple lapel pin?</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Shrugging) I could wear it through my nose</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Finishing her sandwich) Excellent</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> By the way, what makes you think I was being patriotic to THIS country? - England has red, white, and blue as well</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Yes, but your father is not looking to become a member of parliament</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> He might be happier there - you know what the say about Englishmen</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Hush up, that old bitty is returning - we need to make a nice impression - and stop slurping your salad</line>

<stage>Penny makes a face and silently mocks her mother's words.</stage>

<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> (Taking her seat) Oh Pippy - I just thought of something for you...</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Biting her lip) Penelope</line>
<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> Right - my granddaughter goes to an exclusive tanning salon in Alexandria - I could give you her number and she'd be more than happy to help you rid yourself of that ghostly pallor</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> It takes me about an hour each day to achieve this ghostly pallor - why would I want to get rid of it to look like every other Barbie bimbo sporting a shade of bronzed poo?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> I WOULD LOVE SOME MORE TEA, PLEASE</line>
<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> Lydia, I wanted to mention earlier how amazed I was by your presentation concerning your little museum in Duquesa Bay</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Yes, the Chumash heritage display is a cornerstone of our... little museum - we're quite proud of it</line>
<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> And you wrote all of the material yourself?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Now becoming agitated) Yes - my brilliant daughter assisted me with the legwork - hee hee - but I indeed wrote it... word for word!</line>
<line><actor>Mrs. Wembley</actor> (Applauding) Why Lydia, you can write, I am so impressed!</line>

<image  src="../graphics/v17_penny_lydia.jpg" h="587" w="520"  b="0"/>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Deepening her tone) Mrs. Wembley, Multiple Sclerosis is not synonymous with Mental Retardation - not only can I read AND write, I can do it better than 99.9% of the so-called healthy population out there, so, if you are done with your well-meaning condescension, Penelope and I will be on our way</line>

<stage>Now riding in the back of a limousine, the two Renseliers remain silent for a moment.</stage>

<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Finally breaking it) Did you have to be so mean to her, mom?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> I'm just sick and tired of all of these people treating my brain like an invalid when it's only my body that deserves the reputation</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Playing with her bracelets) They just don't get it and they never will... until it happens to them or someone close to them</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> They're adults with an education supposedly past sixth grade, they should be able to grasp this rather simple concept</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Patting her mother's hand) Nothing with you is ever simple, mom</line>

<stage>Lydia kisses her on the head.</stage>

<line><actor>Penelope</actor> Did you take your pills today?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Not yet</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) Can I have them, then?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Wrinkling her nose) Don't be snarky - ooh, look, there's your father waiting for us!</line>

<stage>With a slight grin and golf bag on his shoulder, George waves.</stage>

<line><actor>George</actor> (Getting inside the limo) Did you two have a good lunch with Senator Wembley's wife?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Trying to reposition her cramping leg) Typical</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> I threw pecans at her</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> That's not nice, Pen... did you hit her?</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> Nicked her shin</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Good girl!</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> How was your ROUND of golf?</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Strategic - I met a lot of power players today - they think I have a realistic shot at a congressional seat in a few years</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> That's terrific, Geo</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> What's so great about here, anyway? - California is bigger than most countries - why can't you be happy there?</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> I am happy there, but this is the progressive step that needs to be taken</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> Needs or wants?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Penny</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Scratching his head) A couple of the men I spoke with today are really interested in your brother's new venture</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Douglas has been so secretive about it, I'm not even sure what it involves</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> It involves money and it involves power - the perfect combo for this town</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> True enough</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Hesitant) And... as a result... I have been invited to one of their private clubs later</line>

<line><actor>Penelope</actor> DAD - THAT'S NOT FAIR</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> I'm sorry, Honey</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Pouting) You promised me a tour of the National Cathedral and the Oak Hill Cemetery - those were the only reasons I came on this stupid trip!</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Don't forget about getting out of your classes</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> I promise to make it up to you both - we'll do something fun tomorrow for sure</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> You have a heavy schedule of fund-raising meetings tomorrow</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Staring out the window) You two can go to hell</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Pinching her daughter's leg) Already there, Darling</line>

<stage>George tells the driver to pull over.</stage>

<line><actor>George</actor> Listen, I'll catch a cab from here - you two go on and have a wonderful time, I'll meet you both for dinner</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Kissing his cheek) Good luck, George</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Trying to kiss Penny's cheek) Daddy loves you!</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Turning away and sighing) Sure</line>

<stage>The limo resumes its course. Penelope pulls out a small pad of paper and begins to scrawl wildly on it.</stage>

<stage>I wanna be anesthetized<br>
 Don't wanna look into your eyes<br>
 Don't wanna listen to your cries<br>
 I wanna be anesthetized<br>
 So tired of believing in your lies<br>
 So tired of being mesmerized<br>
 So your life can be sanitized<br>
 I wanna be anesthetized</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Wringing her hands) You know, while we're out here - why don't we check out Georgetown and George Washington University?</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Wiping away a tear) Why would I want to go to college, especially a college that is on the other side of the country... who would wipe your ass?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Penelope, don't be crude</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> It's a valid question and it CERTAINLY wouldn't be dad</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> We'll cross that bridge when we come to it</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Softly) You can't even cross the street</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> With a little luck and the HARD WORK your father is doing now, hopefully, he'll be here in a few years - so, it only makes sense for you to go to school here</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> And where will you be?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Most likely in the ground</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> I wish you wouldn't talk like that</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> But it is the eventual reality</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> It's ALL of our eventual reality - why can't we enjoy just one goddamn trip as a family?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> This is what your father wants in life and I expect you to support him in this, whether I am here or not</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> What my father wants is that fucking faggot back at SCU</line>

<stage>Lydia slaps her daughter hard across the face. Both are momentarily stunned.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> OH GOD, PENNY, GOD, I AM SO SORRY - HONEY, PLEASE</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Pulling away) It's OK - I guess I deserved that</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Tears rolling down her face) No, no you didn't</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Unable to keep from crying) WHY DO YOU LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT? - WHY DO YOU LET HIM TREAT YOU LIKE THAT? - WHY DO YOU LET HIM TREAT US LIKE THAT?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> It's complicated, Baby</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> NO, IT ISN'T - HE EITHER LOVES US OR HE DOESN'T</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Trying to hug her daughter) He DOES love us, Penelope, HE DOES... just not in the way we want him to</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Low whisper) He loves himself more</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> I won't attempt to argue with that</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> How in the hell did you ever fall in love with him?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Bemused smile) Honestly, I don't really know... but I did</line>

<stage>Penelope looks to her mother and reluctantly pats her hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> I was always considered to be &quot;damaged goods&quot; by men, your father was the first one to treat me with respect... to actually regard me as a sexual person</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> I'm not sure I want to hear this</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> You need to hear this - when I first met George, it was very obvious to me that he was bisexual but we still fell in love, we hid behind... and within each other - do you hate me for bringing you into this mess?</line>

<stage>Penny is momentarily stunned by the question.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> You know, if you ever wanted to find your natural parents, I wouldn't blame you in the least</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> No and no... no, I don't hate you - it's not your fault, I suppose it's not anyone's fault - and no, I have no need to find my DNA donors - for all of your fucked-up-ness, you and dad ARE and always WILL BE my real family</line>

<stage>The two share a long, warm embrace.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Heh, here I was thinking I could save this darling 
 little baby they put in my arms and she is the one who ultimately 
 ended up saving me</p>

<line><actor>Penelope</actor> (Kissing her mother's cheek and smiling) An indentured servitude of 18 years</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Playful tone) That's right, slave, now BUFF MY NAILS</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> Yes, master - can we still go to the cemetery later?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Of course, but how about we go shopping first... ON YOUR FATHER'S CREDIT CARD</line>
<line><actor>Penelope</actor> YAY</line>
