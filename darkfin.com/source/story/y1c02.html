<stage>Inside the von Meer family estate on Beacon Point, a blonde woman is sprawled out on the Italian marble floor of her bathroom
    with a small, bleeding gash on her lower left shin. Lying naked in a pool of her own vomit, she shivers and struggles
    to regain consciousness. The woman slowly rises and stumbles over to the sink where she checks the watch she left on
    the counter top.</stage>

    <actor>Erika von Meer</actor> (Gasping) A... marked... improvement</line>

<stage>After splashing her face repeatedly with cold water, Erika begins to chant a Pali prayer as she cleans up and closes the
    opened window.</stage>

<stage>Later that morning, the family begins to gather around a long, mahogany dining table for breakfast.
    <a href="../people.html#kjsr">Karl von Meer</a> sits at the head, reading a newspaper, while his son
    <a href="../people.html#kj">KJ</a>, piles his plate high with eggs, bacon, and more.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Pass me the muffins, would you, son?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Doing so) Here you go, Dad</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> I see someone left a gift for you out front</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> The trailer, I know, I'll take care of it after breakfast</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Returning to his paper) No problem</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Oh, I almost forgot, I'm working with
    <a href="../people.html#ona">Ona Rosa</a> on a pro bono case today and then I'm off to practice, do you mind if we go over the office stuff tomorrow?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> KJ, you promised you'd help out - this is a family business and I want my family involved</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Dad, we're worth over $300,000,000 - no matter what happens, I think we're going to be OK - the charity cases
    I work on involve people who don't know where their next paycheck is coming from</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> I think you just like working with Ona Rosa</line>

<stage>KJ does not respond.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Peering at his son over the paper) She's married with three kids... hands off!</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I resent your implication, Dad - I enjoy her company because she is a very smart, very compassionate woman...
    unlike the usual bevy of the airheads I'm surrounded with daily</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> It doesn't stop you from dating them, does it?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Hell no - that's why I spend my weekends with a smart, married woman</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Shuffling his paper) Fine, I'll just get Erika to help me with the business today - where is she?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I heard the shower running when I came down</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Doesn't that girl spend enough time in the water?</line>

<stage>Pauline von Meer, in her tennis whites, comes charging into the room.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Could someone please explain to me why in the hell there is a U-Haul in the front yard?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Mouth half full) 'Morning, Mom - Gracie left it but she didn't say why on her message</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> (Taking her seat) Gracie, I should've known - I still don't know why you hang around that creature</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Gracie is NOT a creature, she's my friend</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> (Pouring herself a cup of black coffee) She's a fat Oriental midget with eight fingers - that constitutes
    &quot;creature&quot; in my book</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Mother, I will not let your racism ruin my enjoyment of this beautiful blueberry muffin</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> (Looking at her gold and platinum watch) I have a match with that whore
    <a href="../people.html#ursula">Ursula</a> in less than a half hour, WHERE IS MY GODDAMN FRUIT COCKTAIL?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Leaning over and kissing his wife's cheek) Good morning, Darling</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> (Returning it) You have butter on your chin, Dear</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> It could be on worse places</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Heh</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Karl John, do not be vulgar at the breakfast table</line>

<stage>Erika von Meer quietly enters the room and takes her seat. She wearily pours herself a cup of licorice spice tea and takes
    two slices of dry toast.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Good morning, Duchess</line>
<line>
    <actor>EvM</actor> Father</line>

<image  h="310" w="329" src="../graphics/erika_headshot.jpg" alt="Erika Headshot" a="center"/>

<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Thank you for finally honoring us with your presence</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Mother</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Is it really asking too much to have my children share breakfast with their parents once a week?</line>

<stage>Erika and KJ exchange glances with each other.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Mom, Rikka just turned 30 and I'm not far behind, when are you going to stop referring to us as children?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Looking at her brother) Maybe when you stop spilling jam all over your shirt, Kage</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Heh</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Listen, I suffered through a combined 47 hours of labor for you both - you two will ALWAYS be my children</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> What if it had only been 46?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> (Turning to her daughter) Honey, you look like shit!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Thank you</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Rough night at the lab, Sis?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Slowly sipping her tea) You could say that</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Well, it certainly wasn't with a man, poor Griffin has been leaving you messages on the hour</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> My own living cuckoo clock</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Are you going to return them?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Maybe</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Honest to God, Erika, I just don't get you</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Leaning back in his chair) Here we go</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Not looking up from her tea) And what exactly is it you don't get, Mother?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> You</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Yes, you've already established that</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Reading the sports section) I see the Cactus finally won one</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I know, I was at the game with a couple of buddies</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> (Ignoring the men) I wasn't blessed with your physical gifts - I had to work twice as hard on the tour
    to succeed</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> So you've told us... countless times</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Did you see Doug at the game?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Nope</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Erika, you could've been a fashion model, an Olympic athlete... you could've been so much more!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> &quot;Could've&quot; - you talk like I'm already in the grave</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Aren't you?</line>

<stage>Erika folds her arms and looks away.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I did score with one of the cheerleaders</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> A &quot;Cactus Flower?&quot;</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Yep</line>

<stage>The women continue to ignore them.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> You stick yourself away in a dreary lab, all hours of the day and night - and for what? - SAVING FISH?
    - NO ONE GIVES A FLYING FUCK ABOUT FISH</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT I DO IN THE LAB BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE TO EVEN BEGIN TO COMPREHEND
    IT</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> OH, I GET IT, I'M A DUMB JOCK - I CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY DAUGHTER'S SUPER-SMART WORLD OF NUMBERS AND TEST
    TUBES AND LAB COATS - OOOOOOH</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> We made out in the parking lot behind left field</line>

<image   b="0" h="241" w="236" src="../graphics/kj_headshot.gif" a="center"/>

<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> That's nice</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE EARTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE HERE, WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S
    A BLUE FISH, OR A RED FISH, OR AN ECRU FISH - FIND SOMETHING BETTER TO DO WITH YOUR TIME</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> RIGHT, LIKE CHASE A FUZZY YELLOW BALL AROUND SOME WHITE LINES</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> On the topic of colors, she had pink nipples instead of red ones</line>

<p>Both women in unison: SHUT UP, KJ</p>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I LOVE SATURDAY BREAKFAST</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Heh</line>

<stage>Pauline's cell phone rings as everyone takes a breath.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Hello? - Ursula, Sweetie, are you ready for our match? - WHAT? - AGAIN? - how utterly dreadful, you poor
    thing!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> What?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> (Holding her hand over the phone) More bodies were found on the beach this morning, just a few houses
    down from them</line>

<stage>Erika sips more of her tea.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Looking at his watch) Quick, turn on Channel 8!</line>

<stage>Karl Senior reaches for the remote in back of him and flips on the television.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Dan</actor> (On television) From the lake to the bay, everyday, good morning everyone, I'm
    <a href="../people.html#henshaw">Dan Henshaw</a>... </line>
<line>
    <actor>Claudia</actor>and I'm
    <a href="../people.html#claudia">Claudia Steel</a> and this is NewsCenter 8 at 8... we begin this morning with breaking news on the shore of one of Duquesa
    Bay's most popular beaches, KCON's Morrigan McBride is live at the scene with the very latest, Morrigan...</line>
<line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Claudia, at approximately six o'clock this morning, the bodies of three local men were discovered on
    the southern shore of Celoso Beach by a Coast Guard patrol unit -- although it appears that the men drowned, officials
    have not confirmed the cause of death and declined further comment -- family members of the victims will be notified
    shortly -- according to area residents, there were no signs of a disturbance during the night or in the early morning
    hours, however, because of dense fog, no one can say for sure -- since April of last year, six other bodies have been
    found on area beaches, ranging from Chaparral Heights to Beacon Point -- whether these three are related has yet to be
    determined -- officials from the Coast Guard, along with the Quartz County Sheriff, will be holding a joint press conference
    later this evening, you can be certain we'll have more details on this tragedy for you then -- as for Celoso Beach, it
    will remain closed until further notice... Morrigan McBride, KCON NewsCenter 8</line>

<stage>Erika stares intently at the television while chomping on her toast.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Returning to his paper) Interesting</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> That McBride girl must be new - she's cute in the &quot;wholesome/girl next door/kind you'd marry&quot; type
    of way</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Oh please, she needs to drop about ten pounds and get a tan!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Finishing her tea) On that note, I need to get back to the lab</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Of course you do</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Because of the murders, Crunch won't be at practice today - please ask Shelby if she can fill in?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Rising from her chair and taking a water bottle) I will</line>
<line>
    <actor>Pauline</actor> Karl John, would you PLEASE do something about that hideous trailer outside?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Wiping his mouth and getting up) I'll do that right now, Mom</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Erika, I need your help with the business today</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> I'll be back this afternoon and we can work then, I promise</line>
<line>
    <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Glancing at KJ) Thank you, Duchess</line>

<stage>KJ rolls his eyes as he walks outside of the house with his sister. Erika momentarily loses her balance and leans on her
    brother's arm.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Rik, are you OK?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly) Yeah... just a little groggy</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> DEAR JESUS, PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE GRIFFIN'S SPAWN</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> What?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Are you pregnant?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> WHAT?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Is this morning sickness?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> GIMME A BREAK, KAGE</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I heard you puking in the bathroom earlier, I tried to check on you but the door was locked</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Thanks, but there's no need to worry</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> If you only had a hangover, I wouldn't worry at all</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Look, I just ate something wrong last night, that's it</line>

<stage>The two resume walking.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I know it's hard putting up with all of Mom's crap but she does have a valid point</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> That's a first</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> You're spending WAY too much time in the lab</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Stop taking her side</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I'm not</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> You've always been a &quot;Momma's Boy&quot;</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Well, you're &quot;Daddy's Little Girl,&quot; so I guess we're even</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> I guess</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Mom only says what she does because she loves you</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Why can't she just make me pudding?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> You don't look well, Erika, you haven't been for awhile now</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Pinching her brother's cheek) I'm not the one who didn't shave this morning</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Taking her hand) SERIOUSLY, I'm worried about you!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Patting his hand) Please don't be, I'm fine!</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> You better be</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Since you're feeling so concerned, may I ask a favor?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Sure</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Drop me off at the lab, I don't feel like riding my bike today</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Let's go!</line>

<stage>The two hop in his black Porsche convertible and speed down the driveway.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> You know, you're a better polo player than Crunch and Shelby combined - why don't you play with us anymore?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Putting on her sunglasses) I have more valuable things to do with my time than waste it on frivolous athletic
    competitions</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Doing the same) Don't give me that line - you enjoyed it, I know you did</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> I never said I didn't enjoy it</line>

<stage>The two reach the front of the driveway and are blocked in by the U-Haul.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Slamming on the brakes) DAMN, I almost forgot</line>

<stage>Erika's jaw drops in disbelief at the sight of it.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Noticing) C'mon, Rikka, I can understand Mom's revulsion to it but not you too?</line>

<image   b="0" h="201" w="246" src="../graphics/uhaul.gif" alt="U-Haul" a="center"/>

<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> No... I... uh... it's just not something I expected to see</line>

<stage>KJ gets out of the car and begins to pick the lock of the trailer with his pocket knife.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> What are you doing?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Ordering pizza</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Getting out of the car) Kage, knock it off!</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> This is one of Gracie's practical jokes, I know it!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> What if this really isn't a joke and you're breaking into someone's personal belongings?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Opening the door) Aint it fun?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Folding her arms and stepping back) I will not be an accomplice to this crime</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Yeah, whatever, hand me your mini-flashlight</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Looking in her purse) Lose yours again?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> You really don't want to know where</line>

<stage>The sister tosses the flashlight to her brother in disgust.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Going through boxes) Hmm... ordinary junk, I guess it is legit</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Little Miss Takanachi is going to be furious with you</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Look, I was nice enough to let the owner of this trailer use my driveway...</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) Ahem</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I was nice enough to let the owner of this trailer use OUR FOLKS' driveway until Gracie gets here</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> How are you going to explain the lock?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I heard something inside and broke in to let it out?</line>

<stage>Erika shakes her head &quot;no.&quot;</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> El Ni&ntilde;o?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Over</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Still looking through stuff) I'll think of something to say, I am a lawyer, afterall</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Poor woman</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Catching her) How do you know this belongs to a woman?</line>

<stage>Erika thinks for a second and then quickly points to a box full of cosmetics and bag of tampons.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Purely circumstantial</line>

<stage>Erika goes over to the belongings and picks up a pink octopus with little red hearts all over it.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Squeezing it) Cute</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Ooh... this is really beautiful</line>

<stage>Holding his hand up, KJ displays a strand of rosary beads.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Studying it) That's Belleek porcelain, be very very careful, Kage</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> What are these symbols?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Celtic knots - now, put it away, this is beyond trespassing!</line>

<stage>Following his sister's orders, he does, and then checks the final box.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> OH WOW, IT'S HER</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Who?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> That new chick on the news this morning, Morrigan</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> McBride</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Here's her diploma - she's a Cal. State graduate - and here's a bunch of journalism awards... what does this
    one say?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Taking the plaque from her brother) &quot;Hinc quam sic calamus saevior ense, patent.&quot;</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I know it's Latin but what does it mean?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> You're a lawyer, you should know Latin</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> I only know what I need to know like &quot;fellatio&quot; - now, what does the damn thing say?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword.&quot;</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> BORING - I was hoping for a Satanic chant of some kind</line>

<stage>As KJ's pager goes off, Erika suddenly notices a spot of blood and scales on the ragged edge of the trailer's metal bumper.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> (Looking at his pager) Speak of the devil, it's Gracie - she'll be by in a little bit to pick up the trailer</line>

<stage>Carefully, the sister takes out a tissue and wipes up the stain without her brother noticing.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Slipping the tissue into her pocket) Can we please get going now?</line>
<line>
    <actor>KJ</actor> Sure - give me a few minutes to get this into the garage and out of Mom's sight, and then we'll take off</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> One more thing... I need to make a quick stop on the way to pay a bill</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Awhile later, Erika enters the lab at Santa Conchita University where
    <a href="../people.html#shelby">Shelby Willis</a> is conducting an experiment.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Good morning, Shel</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> (Removing protective goggles) Oh, there's that look, I see that look - that's the look of &quot;I just
    had breakfast with my whole stinking family&quot; look!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Putting on her lab coat) How perceptive of you</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Girl, you better not be bringing that look anywhere near me, I am having too good of a day for that!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Going over her) Good news on the kelp tests?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> GREAT NEWS ON THE KELP TESTS, TAKE A LOOK</line>

<stage>The two go over the data.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Excellent results on the Giant Kelp... you might have to recheck the Understory Kelp, however</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> I realize that - why else do you think I'm here on a Saturday?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Because you love me?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> AHA - you are a good girl but no amount of love can bring me into work on a weekend</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Smiling) Except for results like these</line>

<stage>The two chuckle and continue their work</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> So, did you hear about the dead men on Celoso Beach?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Does this involve a priest, a rabbi, and a sailor?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> This is not a joke</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Oh</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Captain Craig just called</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Uh-huh</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> It turns out one of the men was a father of a girl in my son's school</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> That's a shame</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Anyway, he wants to talk to you about the situation</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> As usual</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> The press will, as well</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Rubbing her forehead) Sandy can play &quot;Dr. Soundbite&quot; for the university today</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Aren't you feeling well, Erika?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Not you, too</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Forgive me for giving a monkey's crap!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> No, it's just... I'm a little tired</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - SPEND YOUR WEEKEND RESTING OR HAVING FUN... NOT WORKING</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> I could say the same to you</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> (Taking off her lab coat) I'm heeding that very advice and leaving</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Kage needs you at polo practice today</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Captain Craig already asked me, that's where I'm going now - you should, too!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Preparing some beakers) No thanks, I need to do this</line>
<line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Very well then, I'll see you Monday</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Goodbye, Shel</line>

<stage>A few moments later, after making sure she's alone, Erika closes the blinds and locks the lab door. Taking out a syringe,
    she draws blood from herself and then collects a urine sample. Later in the day, she takes out a black &amp; white speckled
    log book from her leather satchel, everything inside is written in Prakrit.</stage>

    <p>Complete Morph #24</p>


    <p>WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT: 6.84 x10E3/uL
        <br> RED BLOOD CELL COUNT: 4.38 x10E6/uL
        <br> HEMOGLOBIN: 12.0 g/dL
        <br> HEMATOCRIT: 37.1%
        <br> SODIUM: 137 mmol/L
        <br> POTASSIUM: 3.5 mmol/L
        <br> CO2 CONTENT: 25 ol/L
        <br> ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE: 98 U/L</p>


    <p>After total saltwater submersion, the morph occured within 6.4 seconds, compared to the last one at 7.1 seconds. Mean
        water temperature was 59 F. Total time of the morph was approximately 3 hours without a resubmergence. The recovery
        time continues to lessen, however, dehydration is still a problem.</p>


    <p>Personal Note: I'm not as dizzy today but slight nausea and a transient migraine persist. I remember all of my actions
        while transmogrified. Part of me wishes I didn't. The charge of my trident continues to be an issue. Unfortunately,
        electrical engineering is not my forte. A larger issue looms, and her name is Morrigan McBride. I'm almost certain
        that she was unaware of my presence but I cannot be entirely sure. Further observation is required.</p>

<stage>The lab phone rings simultaneously with Erika's cell phone. The woman lets them ring for half a dozen times and then finally
    picks one up.</stage>

    <actor>Erika</actor> Hello, Griffin</line>

<image   b="0" h="237" w="192" src="../graphics/griffin_headshot.gif" a="center"/>

<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> I was going to get you, one way or the other</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> What do you want?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> Have lunch with me?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Aren't you at practice?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> Have a late lunch with me after practice?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Sorry, I need to help out my father this afternoon</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> Have an early dinner with me after you work with Karl?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Sighing) Griffin</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> Say yes, say yes, I know you want to, say yes!</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> If I agree, will you leave me alone until then?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> YES</line>
<line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Alright, pick me up around 5:30 - goodbye, Griffin</line>

<stage>Inside his stately, Neoclassic office,
    <a href="../people.html#griffin">Griffin Martel</a> leans back in his chair with a smug smile. His assistant, a large Samoan man, enters carrying an athletic
    bag and polo mallet.</stage>

<line>
    <actor>Asst.</actor> Are you ready, Sir?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> Those three little matters we had this morning... have all traces of their employment been eliminated?</line>
<line>
    <actor>Asst.</actor> Taken care of, Mr. Martel</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> (Getting up to leave) Good</line>
<line>
    <actor>Asst.</actor> We still don't know who... or what... killed them</line>
<line>
    <actor>Griffin</actor> A puzzle I look forward to solving... a problem I look forward to eliminating!</line>
