      <h1>Duquesa Bay</h1>
      <p>
        In the California coastal community of Duquesa Bay, a lone vigilante speaks for a whole other world, just beneath the surface.
        Adored by some, abhorred by others she is Darkfin and this is her story. </p>

      <h4>Quartz County, California contains the Santa Conchita Valley which is the home of four communities:</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Duquesa BayÂ®</strong> - Population: 35,000 A combination of rich, beach front properties and a college town (Santa
        Conchita University (28)).</p>

      <p>Beacon Point (24) is an ultra rich section of Duquesa Bay, home to approximately 1,000 people, known as the "Platinum
        K".</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Chaparral Heights</strong> - Population: 30,000 Upper-middle class suburbia with lots of upscale strip malls and
        planned communities.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Santa Conchita</strong> - Population: 40,000 The oldest portion of Quartz County, Santa Conchita grew up near the
        Santa Conchita Mission (now a historical site). Much of the original Santa Conchita is decaying industrial areas
        and farm based businesses.
      </p>

      <p>South Side is the most run down and low income section of the valley. It is home to abandoned factories, migrant farm
        workers and trendy dance clubs.</p>
      <p>East Side edges into open farm land and is home to the remaining farm industries and farm workers.</p>
      <p>North Side is upscale and benefits from proximity to more recently constructed Chaparral Heights.</p>
      <p>West Side is moving more slowly upscale, offering historic and "quaint" housing for SCU students who live outside Duquesa
        Bay. Still mostly working class housing and apartments.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Quartz Lake</strong> - Population: 5,000 Farmland and farm community, but also home to the famous Quartz Lake Inn
        (30), a combination country club and upscale meeting place overlooking beautiful Quartz Lake. Santa Conchita Mission
        Historical Site (12) is located on the western edge of Quartz Lake. The hills surrounding the scenic lake are home
        to a combination of older farmhand housing and more recent secluded mansions.</p>
