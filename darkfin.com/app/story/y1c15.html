<div class="stage">Inside the emergency room of Bay Valley Medical Center, Penny and George Renselier wait as Lydia is treated for her wounds. &nbsp;Brad Martel paces in the hall, eyeing Penny as her father speaks on his cell phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Yes, we're waiting to hear now - no, we're still not sure what happened - it was terrible, I'm so glad you weren't there</p>

<div class="stage">Realizing his daughter is glowering at him, he turns in his seat and speaks in a hushed tone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I'll be by tomorrow - I love you, too</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Arms folded) I have no idea who your new playmate is and I could, quite frankly, care less BUT I do care about my mother, YOUR WIFE, who is going through multiple levels of shit right now - stick the cell up your ass and show some respect!</p>

<div class="stage">The elder Renselier thinks about a retort, decides against one and quickly puts the phone away in his pocket as Brad chuckles in the corner. &nbsp;Dr. Stephanie Gates emerges from the other room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Aunt Steph, is mom alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> A few cuts and bruises, elevated blood pressure, she'll be fine</p>

<div class="stage">Both Renseliers breathe a sigh of relief.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> She's very lucky - the gash to her neck, if it were three centimeters deeper, Lyd would be in real trouble right now</p>

<div class="stage">Penny covers her faces and rubs it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Can we see her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Sure, go on in - she's sedated but still coherent</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Pausing) How are the others that were brought in? - Mr. Braemar?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Mostly minor wounds, Mr. Braemar is the only critical one - he's in surgery right now</p>

<div class="stage">Inching closer, Brad is standing in back of Penny.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Looking at her niece and her son) The paramedics say if it weren't for you two, he'd be dead right now</p>

<div class="stage">The scruffy man and the exhausted girl look at each other and then quickly look away. &nbsp;The Renselier daughter goes inside to see her mother.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Watching Brad watch Penny) Why are you really here, Bradley?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Scratching his face) To check up on Mr. Braemar, of course... actually, mom, I was wondering if I could stay with you for a few days?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I was kinda evicted</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> IT WASN'T MY FAULT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> No, it never is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I asked dad but he only told me to grow up - Grif and Vicky won't return my calls - Ben said I could stay with him but Claudia insists I sleep in the garage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> What about your friends? - you know what, forget about those creeps</p>

<div class="stage">Sighing, she fetches her house key from her pocket and tosses it to Brad.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> We'll discuss this further when I get home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (All smiles) Thanks!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Hearing her name paged) I'm not doing you any favors</p>

<div class="stage">She takes off as Brad tries to peek inside the door at Penny. &nbsp;Lydia opens her eyes and squeezes her husband's hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> George - I need to...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Patting the hand) Shh, you need to do nothing but rest, doctor's orders!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Penelope - please get my assistant on the phone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Mom, that's not a good idea right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Diving into her father's pocket) I don't have Brenda's number with me</p>

<div class="stage">Mrs. Renselier rattles off the number as her daughter rolls her eyes and dials.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Hi, Bren - yeah, mom's fine - she wants to know... WHAT?</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia grabs the phone out of Penny's hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Brenda, what's going on? - WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY TAKE THAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> What's wrong?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Along with the Duquesa's Tears, some mission statue was stolen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Keep me informed, I'll be there as soon as I can</p>

<div class="stage">Throwing the phone down on the bed, Lydia tries to keep from crying.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Did they steal anything else?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> DIDN'T THEY STEAL ENOUGH?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Mom, calm down</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="291" w="200" src="assets/images/y1c15statues.jpg" a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Brenda and the police checked through everything a half dozen times - the only two items taken were the necklace and the mission statue</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I can understand the necklace but what's so special about that statue?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> It doesn't make any sense, we have several of those very same statues in storage - they were mass produced by the Chumash for the Spanish missionaries to sell back in Europe - they have a value of several hundred dollars, tops!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Try not to think about it now, Liddy - let's concentrate on getting you home</p>

<div class="stage">A nurse comes in to take her vitals.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> (To Penny) Ms. Renselier, there's a young man in the hall waiting to see you</p>

<div class="stage">Penelope storms out of the room to find her boyfriend Jeremey hanging out by the vending machines.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jere</span> (Rushing over to her) Pen, are you OK? - Gracie called and told me...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Why weren't you at the ball?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jere</span> Sorry, I didn't really feel like going - besides, I had to help out at Techtonic - I GOT TO DO MY OWN SET, isn't that rad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> FUCK YOU</p>

<div class="stage">She turns and heads back into her mother's room. &nbsp;Watching from the side, Brad saunters over to a confused Jere and snickers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jere</span> What's your problem?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Jere, Jere, Jere - little boy, she is SO out of your league</p>

<div class="stage">The young man stiffens up and clenches his teeth.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jere</span> (Scanning Brad's cowboy costume) You better hurry or you'll miss your YMCA number</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Heh, you better hurry and grow some dick before your girlfriend turns elsewhere to find it</p>

<div class="stage">The two get in a shoving match.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Chill out, dude, I was just giving you some friendly advice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jere</span> (Trying to get in a solid punch) You know what you can do with your advice!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Pushing Jere back into a chair) Hey, I wouldn't want you to hurt those magic music hands of yours!</p>

<div class="stage">A hospital orderly rushes over and escorts them out of the building. &nbsp; Jeremey takes off on his bike as Brad zooms by him in his black truck.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Stopping and rolling down the window) Styling wheels, man, I'm sure the ladies love riding on your handlebars!</p>

<div class="stage">The Martel brother cackles and takes off again. &nbsp;About a half mile down the road, his truck makes a grinding noise and lurches to a stop. &nbsp;With a mock wave and smile, Jeremey rides past him.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">As the turmoil in and around the Quartz County Museum lessens just a bit, KCON's best field producer, Gracie Takanachi, finishes collecting and editing her footage as the Daily Beacon's Zachary Isaacson trots over with his notes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Did you find Morri yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No, and there a few other people missing as well - I saw Griffin and he's frantically looking for Dr. von Meer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Huh, maybe they panicked and ran for the hills, I know I'd still be running from this mess</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> It doesn't seem like M&amp;M to run</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Checking some wires) I know - and that's what has me really concerned</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Before I was kicked out by the cops, I saw a ton of blood and spent ammo in the courtyard, more than just a jewelry heist went down here tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Watching another emergency vehicle take off) Was anyone killed?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I can't get a confirmation but I highly suspect so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Taking a deep breath) OK, keeping the train wreck in mind, we are NOT going to think the worst</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Thinking the worst) Right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Morrigan is probably following a lead somewhere and she'll get in touch with us when she's ready</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> That or her body will float up somewhere</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Bopping him on the arm) ZACH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> WHAT? - you told me to think about what happened with the train wreck!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Look, we have jobs to do, let's just do them</p>

<div class="stage">Isaacson notices a disheveled Kylee Shepperton hurrying over to them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (To Gracie) Speaking of jobs</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Grace, do you have some notes for me to look at?</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="207" w="215" src="assets/images/y1c15kylee.jpg" a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Benny said Steel was coming over to do the stand-up?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Fixing her makeup) Well, Benny is wrong - Claudia is not here, I am, let's go!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Gee, Kyleekins, how come you just got here? - weren't you supposed to be at this fancy shindig?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Setting up for the shot) You're in my way, Zach, MOVE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Handing Kylee her notes) Funny, I haven't seen Mr. Gates around, either</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> If you MUST know, we were both tied up in meetings with the network executives</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Were Prussick knots involved?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Checking in with the station) Closing in on one minute</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Putting in her IFB) Look, I wanted to be here - getting stuck in a meeting was not my first choice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Under her breath) &quot;Stuck&quot; is the operative word you corporate fuck doll</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> EXCUSE ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Fake smile) I said, &quot;it's a good thing you're here afterall&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">Zach swallows his laughter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Because of the deal we struck at the meeting tonight, you will have a paycheck this week, Ms. Takanachi, you'd be wise to remember that!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> And you'd be wise to remember your in cue - 30 SECONDS</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Still tracking the cloaked figure running with the large sack, Morrigan edges close to the waterfront. &nbsp;The thickening fog is making it more difficult to see. &nbsp;The figure starts to slow down in the sand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself) What do I do now?</p>

<div class="stage">The figure pauses and looks towards the sea, waiting. &nbsp;Stumbling over a large clump of washed up kelp, Morrigan has an idea. &nbsp;She grabs a long strand of the thick vegetation to use as a rope and carefully approaches the figure.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (In her mind) On the count of three... one, two, HAAA</p>

<div class="stage">She throws the kelp rope around the figure and pulls it tight against him. &nbsp; He's thrown to the ground and remains motionless.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> GOTCHA - what's in the bag pal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Figure</span> (Deep and eerie) You'll figure it out</p>

<div class="stage">Instantly recognizing the same voice that warned her on the phone earlier, she carefully goes to check the contents. &nbsp;The figure snaps the seaweed around him and deftly hurls Morrigan towards the ocean. &nbsp;Landing hard in the surf, the KCON reporter screams for help as the figure calmly gathers the sack and heads off into the fog. &nbsp;Trying to recuperate from her head fin injury, Darkfin hears the commotion and swims over to investigate. &nbsp;She observes Morrigan now running along the beach, batting at the fog around her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying to catch her breath) I know he went in this direction... I think - DAMMIT - WHERE ARE YOU, YOU HOODED COWARD?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Following her at a distance) That sounds familiar</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="220" w="420" src="assets/images/y1c15chopper_night.jpg"/>


<div class="stage">In the skies over Duquesa Bay, Lieutenant Fiore pilots the helicopter as Captain Phelps searches the waters below with a large spotlight.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> They HAVE to be here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> We've search up and down, there are no boats - our teams in the water have given the all clear - I don't know about you, but I'm tired of dancing in the dark</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Keep looking</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> FOR GODSAKES CAPTAIN, there's nothing out here except a lonely seal and increasing fog - we need to get back</p>

<div class="stage">A disgusted Craig frowns at the fog and slams his hand against the window.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Look, the police have every road in and out of town blocked off - we will continue to search every ship that leaves the Bay area for the next year if we have to - if that necklace is still here, we'll find it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Sighing) You're right, lieutenant, let's return to base</p>

<div class="stage">After running up the coast for several miles, a bewildered Morrigan collapses on the shore as she realizes her increasingly painful shoulder was dislocated by being thrown by the cloaked figure.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking up into the fog) This is stupid, that guy is long gone - I need to go back and get help</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="311" w="220" src="assets/images/y1c15beach_night.jpg" a="center"/>


<div class="stage">As she starts to her knees, she feels two, cold, slimy hands firmly grab a hold of her neck.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (In back of Morrigan) Remain still or die</p>

<div class="stage">The odd, female voice is not the one of the cloaked figure. &nbsp;Overwhelmed by the same feeling she had on the night she first entered town and again in the Santa Conchita River, McBride tries to keep as calm as she can.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Your worst nightmare</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can you be a little more original?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Tell me about the man in the robe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Gasping) I would if I could breathe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Only slightly loosening her grip) Did he say anything to you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not really, I saw him running from the museum with a sack, I followed him here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You never lost sight of him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Would you mind taking your slimy hands off me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> ANSWER THE QUESTION</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe for a few moments but never for very long</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Disturbed) He must have friends</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do you have friends?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Looking up at the approaching helicopter) Do not worry about what is in back of you, focus on what is directly in front of you!</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, Morrigan feels a sharp blow to the back of her head and blacks out. &nbsp;As Craig gives one last sweep with the spotlight, he notices movement by the tidal pools.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> DID YOU SEE THAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I just saw something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Tugging on his costume sleeve) Blackbeard's treasure?</p>

<div class="stage">The captain aims the spotlight on the shore and discovers a woman's body.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> OH GOD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> TAKE IT DOWN</p>

<div class="stage">The Coast Guard helicopter quickly descends and lands on the shore. &nbsp;Craig runs over as Anita radios for assistance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Gently turning her over) JESUS, IT'S MCBRIDE - she's alive!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Running up to them with a first aid kit) What is up with this chica?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Checking her over) It looks like someone konked her pretty hard in back of the head</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> An ambulance is on its way</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="248" w="236" src="assets/images/anita_headshot.gif" a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Administering smelling salts) Ms. McBride, MORRIGAN - do you understand me?</p>

<div class="stage">Covered in sand and soaked in sea water, she gags on the smell and flutters her eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What... what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Why don't you tell us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Where did...</p>

<div class="stage">Thinking of the cold hands around her neck, she stops herself before she says anything more.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Captain Phelps?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Getting in her face) Finish your thought - &quot;where did&quot; WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Now sitting up) Where did the guy go I was chasing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Looking around) What guy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I saw someone running away from the museum with a sack</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I KNEW IT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> What did he look like?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't know, he was in a hooded robe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Why didn't you go for help?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I didn't have time and I didn't have my cell phone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Then what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I caught up to him, we struggled and that's all I remember</p>

<div class="stage">Craig takes off to search the area as Morrigan slowly rises to her feet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Giving her a hand) Maybe you should stay on the ground, you have one wicked welt on the back of your head</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pulling away) I'll be fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Noticing the unusual red marks around the woman's neck) Did he try to strangle you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh, I guess</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Did he say anything?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Reflecting) Focus on what is directly in front of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> ANITA</p>

<div class="stage">The lieutenant bolts off in the direction of her captain's yell with Morrigan staggering behind. &nbsp;All three stare at a tidal pool illuminated by Craig's flashlight. &nbsp;The Duquesa's Tears lie among the tiny starfish, anemones, urchins and limpets.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Blackbeard's treasure for sure!</p>
