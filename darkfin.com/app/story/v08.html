<div class="stage">Inside one of the large private rooms of the Techtonic Nightclub, KCON's annual office holiday party takes place. Gracie
    Takanachi is reluctantly DJ-ing while her co-workers fight over insufficient amounts of shrimp and meatballs. Zach Isaacson
    enters the establishment, helps himself to a drink, and ambles over to his disinterested friend.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Taking off her earphones) Welcome to my nightmare!</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v8_gracie.jpg" h="364" w="420" b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Looking around at the people) Thanks for inviting me - I always enjoy sharing your pain</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie studies Zach's t-shirt. It reads &quot;Jesus Wouldn't Drive That Way&quot; in bold green.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Putting on another CD) That's nice and festive</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v8_zach.jpg" h="369" w="420" b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> It's my reaction to getting cut off by all of these Christian soccer moms in their evil mini-vans</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Maybe if you bought a faster car</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> It doesn't matter what kind of car I have, they're still going 50 mph in a 25 mph zone... all I see are
    taillights and those annoying little fish symbols</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Did you peek at your present or did Morri tell you?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Huh?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie reaches over into her bag and hands a small, unevenly wrapped gift to Eyes.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Ripping it open) COOL - um, I'm bringing your present back with me from Chicago</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

<div class="stage">A delighted Zach holds up a Darwin Fish humping a Jesus Fish and then another one that reads &quot;Gefilte Fish.&quot;</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Giving her a big bear hug) AWESOME, I LOVE YOU, GRACE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Where is M&amp;M?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> How in the hell should I know, do I look like her Palm Pilot?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> WHOA, DOWN GIRL</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> It's just she's been acting extremely flaky lately - bailing on dinner with me TWICE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> She's probably with KJ</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> He hardly sees her, asks ME to have her get in touch with HIM</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> You know our Morri, she's like a bug light - she attracts all the weirdness to her so the rest of us can
    enjoy the picnic</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> No - something else is going on... something fishy</p>

<div class="stage">Stringing up real garland of holly and pinecones, Dan Henshaw nearly falls on top of Zach.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Dan</span> (Stumbling) Eh, so sorry, Mr. Isaacson</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Bracing him) Need some help there, Danny?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Dan</span> Yes, thank you - it seems I'm not as tall as I once thought I was</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie shakes her head and sighs as Zach tacks up the end of the garland.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Sniffing the arrangement) Mmm, did you do this yourself?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Dan</span> Of course, Trudy and I stayed up all night making it</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (To herself) Poor Trudy!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Dan</span> Everything came directly out of the Henshaw garden... and the Beasley's garden next door, but don't tell
    them
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Shaking something off of his arm) Love the crawling ladybug, nice touch!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Aghast) DAN... WHAT IS THAT IN YOUR OTHER HAND?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Dan</span> (Holding it up over her head) This? - it's mistletoe... and you know what that means</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> No, NO NO</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Dan</span> (Puckering up) TIME FOR A KISS</p>

<div class="stage">As Gracie steps back, Austin Ortega runs over and smacks Dan dead on the lips.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Dan</span> UUUAAAHHH</p>

<div class="stage">Dan runs off as Austin and Zach cackle in hysterics.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Smiling) Now THAT made my evening!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Ooh, don't make me laugh anymore - I need to take a leak, I'll be right back</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> Let me know if there's anything worthwhile in the men's room</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie pokes at the little lights on Austin's tie.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> What can I say, I like to twinkle!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Aw, man</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> (Pulling out a CD) Gracie, I want to you play Liza's version of &quot;Frosty The Snowman&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Now see, you just went and ruined my evening</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> C'mon, PLEASE? - it's either that or &quot;Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I HATE YOU</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> Look, it's bad enough I'm going to have to MC this faux soiree, the least you can do is play me some happy
    music!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hey, I got stuck DJ-ing this thing AND putting together the office blooper reel</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> Do the bloopers include Kylee?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Do you have to ask?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> Then, it wasn't so bad, was it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Grumbling) Touche</p>

<div class="stage">A co-worker comes over to Gracie and hands her a slip of paper as Austin spots a vodka bottle hidden behind her turntable
    and pours some into his punch.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Crinkling up the paper) UGH - if I have to play Bing Crosby, Tom Jones, or Jingle Cats again, I'll cut
    off my remaining fingers and start throwing them at people</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> (Stirring his drink with his pinky) Or you could cover them in BBQ sauce and serve them as cocktail franks</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Pounding on a few control buttons) Why do I have to play such lame crap?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> Well, not everyone can appreciate the Skribble &amp; Anthony Acid Mix of Pink's &quot;Most Girls&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at her watch) No shit... get up there, Austin, and get this thing over with!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> (Taking the stage and mike) HEY HEY EVERYBODY</p>

<div class="stage">There is a tepid response in the room.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> WHERE'S YOUR SEASONAL SPIRIT? - LET'S SHOW SOME ENTHUSIASM HERE</p>

<div class="stage">Sporadic clapping breaks out.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> AT LEAST IT'S NOT RAINING AND IT'S 70 DEGREES OUTSIDE - ANOTHER GLORIOUS CALIFORNIA HOLIDAY</p>

<div class="stage">It is absolutely quiet again.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> WE ALL HAVE JOBS IN THE NEW YEAR</p>

<div class="stage">The crowd erupts into loud cheering.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> And with that segue, our wonderful boss has a few things to say before he leaves on his ski trip to Veil
    - GIVE IT UP FOR TURNER GATES</p>

<div class="stage">Wearing a goofy snowflake sweater, Turner approaches the mike as his employees try to muster genuine applause.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Turner</span> Thank you, everyone, and Merry Christmas - Happy Hanukkah - Joyous Kwanzaa!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> YOU FORGOT SOLSTICE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Turner</span> Right, Takanachi... anyway, it's been a great year for us here at KCON, thanks in large part to the tragedies
    that have taken place in Duquesa Bay - we're up for several awards as a result and had more than a few of our packages
    go national - the network suits are impressed, people, so keep up the outstanding work - I'd also like to say a few words
    of appreciation to the newest member of our on-air team, Morgan McBride... Morgan, are you here? - heh, she's probably
    hard at work on another story</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> (Aside to Gracie) She probably won't respond until he says her name right</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> She's not here</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> Where is she?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I DUNNO</p>

<div class="stage">Turner starts to hand out gift baskets to everyone. Gracie receives hers and starts rummaging through it.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> (Leaving his intact) Great, now I have something to give to the mailman</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> THERE'S NO CHECK IN HERE</p>

<div class="stage">Austin lets loose with mock laughter as Zach returns to their side.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> FUCKING STRAWBERRY JAM? - THAT'S MY CHRISTMAS BONUS?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> My boss gave out gift certs to Honeybaked Ham - I told him I was Jewish and he said they had turkey there
    as well</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Austin</span> (Smirking) Excuse me, you two, I see Joel in legal is giving me the eye</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Do I dare ask which eye?</p>

<div class="stage">As Austin struts away, a female co-worker comes over to Fingers and Eyes and kindly offers them some pastries. They graciously
    decline.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> I haven't seen that chick before - is she new or someone's wife?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Grimacing) That's Happy Janice, the vampire-toothed receptionist for the assignment desk, and her precious
    homemade sweet rolls - who in the hell brings baked goods to a holiday party?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Bizarre, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I mean, I could never eat those sweet rolls - they look like a black man's asshole</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> And you would know this how, Grace?</p>

<div class="stage">Takanachi elbows Isaacson in the ribs.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> I know, let's ask Jason if they look familiar to him</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> ZACH</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> HEY, JASON, COME OVER HERE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> (Walking over with a plate) Hey man, what's up?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Just ignore Zach, he's drunk</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> I have a pool going on where exactly Kylee will blow Turner tonight - three feet from the singing Christmas
    tree is still open, you want in?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> Sorry, I'm already in a pool for who would be the first to piss on the ice sculpture - hey, Gracie, would
    you like to dance?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Thanks, Clark, but I'm not in a dancing mood - in a few hours, I'll be boarding a plane to Seattle to
    see my family - last time, I was trapped next to two Mormon college boys droning on about the CleanFlicks version of
    &quot;The Patriot&quot; - I wanted to jump out over Southern Oregon</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me - I guess I should go back and battle Henshaw
    for the last buffalo wing</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> It's comforting to know that Dan still can't pass up free food even though he has a three million dollar
    contract
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> (Turning around) Oh Gracie, you haven't seen Morrigan, have you?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> NOOOOO - DO I NEED A SIGN AROUND MY NECK OR SOMETHING?</p>

<div class="stage">Jason shrugs at Zach and takes off. Claudia Steel sneaks up behind Gracie and glares at her.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Spooked) YOW - CLAUDIA, IS THAT YOU OR THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS FUTURE?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Claudia</span> Cut the crap, Gracie - hi, Isaacson</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Clau - do you have any fun plans for the holiday?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Claudia</span> Sleeping</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Sleeping is good</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Claudia</span> In the last 48 hours, I had to go to my oldest daughter's holiday dance recital, followed by her school's
    Christmas concert, dislodge my son's head from a door wreath, help the church set up for their charity auction, shovel
    dry meat to the homeless on behalf of the station, listen to my sister bitch about why I'm the &quot;bad sister&quot;
    because she's stuck taking care of our folks, went to my in-laws for the big Martel family dinner and had to feign interest
    about their lives, got lectured by my husband for apparently not feigning enough interest, and finally convincing my
    youngest that there are other things to play with besides trash</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Zach blink at each other.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Claudia</span> Austin tells me you have a bottle of Stoli over here, is this true?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Maybe</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Claudia</span> Look, I have had it with the fruit punch, the eggnog, and the wine coolers... GIMME THE GODDAMN BOTTLE,
    TAKANACHI
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Ask nicely, Steel, and I might be inclined to share</p>

<div class="stage">The older woman grits her teeth and sucks in some air.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Claudia</span> May I please have some of your liquor, Grace?</p>

<div class="stage">Taking the bottle out, Gracie pours a little into her cup and then into Zach's.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Claudia</span> What are you doing?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I said I would share but I didn't say I would share with you</p>

<div class="stage">Claudia groans, grabs the bottle out of Gracie's hand, and storms off.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I am SO glad that I'm not married with kids!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Is it me or does Claudia seem extra creepy in the face tonight?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> She's shot up with Botox so her forehead won't move - it stops the lines on camera</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> I am so glad I don't have to work in TV</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> No, you just have to work with butt-ugly print people</p>

<div class="stage">In a stunning red cocktail dress, Kylee Shepperton walks by.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Speaking of butt ugly...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Rolling her eyes) Do you WORK for KCON, Zach?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> I could ask you the same thing</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Kylee</span> Gracie, you need to find better dates</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I could tell you the same thing</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Zach wink at each other as Kylee gives them the finger.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> AT LAST, THE TRUE MEANING OF THE SEASON</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v8_austin.jpg" h="474" w="420" b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Pointing to the dance floor) Um, I kinda think that is</p>

<div class="stage">Austin Ortega and a reluctant Dan Henshaw are doing the &quot;Weather Dance&quot; together to Daft Punk's &quot;One More
    Time.&quot; With the exception of Claudia Steel draining the last of Gracie's bottle, everyone urges Dan on with the
    dance, a bastardized version of the Macarena with a touch of &quot;Washing the Windows.&quot;</div>
