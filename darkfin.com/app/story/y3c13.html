<div class="stage">A private jet makes its final approach over Sacramento. 
 The pilot struggles to regain control of the airplane as its passengers 
 are tossed around like ragdolls.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> LYDIAAAAAAAAA</p>

<div class="stage">George is thrown across the cabin and slams up against 
 the floor as the aircraft is now upside down and drops 5,000 feet in 
 ten seconds. Lydia screams as her cane goes flying and smacks a floating 
 Penelope in the face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> (Screaming) OH GOD, SAVE US, SAVE US</p>

<div class="stage">The jet veers in the opposite direction and shifts on 
 its side. George's head is bloodied from the hit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> This... should not... be happening</p>
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3_c13_george.jpg" h="419" w="410"/>


<div class="stage">The airplane momentarily steadies itself and returns 
 to a normal position.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> GEORGE, GEORGE, HELP ME</p>

<div class="stage">George looks to their unresponsive daughter across the 
 way.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> GEORGE</p>

<div class="stage">George staggers over to Lydia's side and helps her with 
 her seatbelt.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> (Crying) Your head</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> I'm fine... Penny!</p>

<div class="stage">The representative stumbles over debris clogging up the 
 aisle in a desperate attempt to reach his daughter. All engines suddenly 
 cease and the jet drops into another death spiral.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> (Pinned against the back wall) I... love you... Penny</p>

<div class="stage"> Lydia screams. Everything goes dark.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> (Gasping) Tim</p>

<div class="stage">Minutes later, George squints his eyes open. He peers 
 around and realizes that the jet did not crash and that he's safely 
 on the ground.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> (Taking a deep breath) Wh... what the...</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia's soft sobbing causes him to jump up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> (Touching his head) Ahh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> George</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> I'm here... PENELOPE</p>

<div class="stage">He spots his lifeless daughter on the other side of the 
 plane and races over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> OH GOD, NO, NO - NOT HER - PLEASE, NOT HER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> George, I think I broke my leg - I... I can't walk!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> WHEN COULD YOU EVER WALK?</p>

<div class="stage">The fierceness of the tone stuns them both. George now 
 cradles Penelope in his arms.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> (Weeping) Please, not my little girl - TAKE ME, TAKE 
 ME INSTEAD</p>

<div class="stage">The shaken pilot and co-pilot now appear before George.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Pilot</span> Emergencies crews are on the tarmac, they'll be here 
 soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> (Rocking Penny) Thank you... thank you both for getting 
 us down safely</p>

<div class="stage">The pilot and co-pilot share a look and then offer a 
 dazed shrug.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Pilot</span> We didn't do a damn thing, Mr. Renselier... we have 
 no idea how this aircraft landed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> I'm sorry?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Co-pilot</span> We blacked out... we all should be dead right now</p>

<div class="stage">Penny suddenly sucks in a huge gulp of air and sits straight 
 up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> George</span> (Releasing her) PENNY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penelope</span> I knew we would have been better off back home</p>

<div class="stage">The pilots back away in fear as George stares at her 
 in shock. Penelope's eyes are glowing a deep blue as she turns to Lydia.</div>

<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3_c13_penny_eyes.jpg" h="406" w="460"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> Isn't that right, mother?</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Tim fetches the black rucksack and hurries back towards 
 the Jeep. Erika runs over to the bathroom door while grabbing on some 
 clothes as quick as she can.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Whispering) Morrigan, can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Yeah, what's going on out there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Our ride has just arrived</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Do you want me to come out?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No, not yet - carefully open the bathroom window and 
 listen for my whistle - when you hear it, go find some clothes and a 
 hat, and then get ready to leave - got it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Okay</p>

<div class="stage">With the utmost stealth, Erika makes her way outside 
 and sneaks up behind Tim. She flips the hunting knife around and uses 
 the heavy butt to knock him on the back of the neck. Tim instantly collapses 
 to the ground.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Taking the car keys and his sunglasses) So sorry to 
 do this to you, Timothy, but I do not have a choice</p>

<div class="stage">She grabs under his arms and drags him back to the cabin 
 porch. She quickly takes off his clothes and leaves him on the swing 
 in the black silk robe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I must say, you could not have come at a better time</p>

<div class="stage">She checks his vitals and his eyes to make sure she didn't 
 hit him too hard.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Do not worry, I will take good care of your Jeep and 
 I will make all of this up to you... I promise</p>

<div class="stage">She covers him with the blanket so Morrigan can't see. 
 Erika now puts the parka back on and whistles.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I heard that!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan darts out of the bathroom, gets dressed, grabs 
 a box of crackers and some water for the road, and runs outside.</div>

<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3_c13_erika_morrigan.jpg" h="494" w="410"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Noticing the lump under the blanket) Who is that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Deepening her voice) Nevermind, get in the back of 
 the Jeep and crouch down as much as possible</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> YOU DIDN'T KILL AGAIN, DID YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> NO, now go!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan runs over to the Jeep and climbs inside. Erika 
 quickly checks around and follows behind.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Starting the engine) We are most fortunate to have 
 a way out of here - unfortunately, this vehicle has no cover</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Beggars can't be choosers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We will appear odd with our clothing and I cannot take 
 the chance of anyone identifying you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Look, I'm crouching down as much as I can with this 
 stupid bulky bag in the way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Flooring it) Find a way to compensate - hang tight, 
 we need to go off-road because of our earlier visitor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Preparing to dump Tim's bag) Slow down for a sec 
 so I can toss this thing...HOLY HELL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Slamming on the breaks) What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Holding the bag open) Lookie what's inside!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Stunned) My my, I wonder what he was doing with this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Unless it belongs to his brother, Geoff</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> WHO IS GEOFF?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Nevermind - do not dump this, it might come in handy 
 for us later on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Um, handy if we want even MORE trouble</p>

<div class="stage">Erika spots one of the sheriff's cars on the upper road.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Killing the engine) Speaking of which...</p>

<div class="stage">The two remain still as the it passes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Once the pests leave, it will be a straight shot along 
 the riverbank - everyone is too preoccupied with the volcano to notice 
 us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Hope you're right</p>

<div class="stage">They start up again and travel on. Morrigan spots the 
 phone in the front seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Hey, that's a satellite phone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> So it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Reaching for it) I want to make one quick call...</p>

<div class="stage">Erika snatches the phone away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> NO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> WHY?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We cannot have anyone knowing that you are still in 
 town</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What about still alive? - a lot of people think I'm 
 dead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Even better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> My dad...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Thinking of her own) I know... but it is not safe for 
 you yet - give it more time</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan sighs and rubs her eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Fine... so, where are we going? - the undersea Bat 
 Cave?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Up north?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Home? - I thought you said we weren't going to your 
 place?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I am taking you home, your home on Willowbrook</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> HAVE YOU BEEN OUT OF THE WATER TOO LONG?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> The city has been evacuated, no one will suspect that 
 you have returned</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> YOU HAVE COMPLETELY LOST IT, FIN - NO FUCKING WAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Keep the shades drawn and try not to make too much noise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> HELLO, ONE NAME FOR YOU, AMETHYST</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> She should not be an issue</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> SHE TRIED TO FUCKING KILL ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Please stop using that particular obscenity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Well, what do you want me to say except NOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You have heard the words 'keep your friends close and 
 your enemies closer'</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Pardon me for not wanting to share zucchini bread 
 with someone who willingly offered me up to her crew of loonies!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> If Amethyst wanted you dead, she would have killed you 
 long ago</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Thinking) Well, she did try to save Zach... Tallulah 
 always liked Amy and... NO NO NO, NOOOOO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Do not fear her for you are vastly more powerful than 
 she is - The Clergy knows this and she will not go after you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Ya think? - 'cause I'm thinking my duplicitous landlord 
 will invite her hood pals over for a backyard blowout starring me as 
 the pale-faced pi&ntilde;ata!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You actually have more color in your cheeks since the 
 incident</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> WHY CAN'T I COME WITH YOU TO THE CAVE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You need to stay on land... and you need a link to The 
 Clergy, Amethyst is that link - find a way to use her as she has used 
 you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Sighing) I just don't think I'm going to be very 
 safe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You will</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> And you know this... HOW?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Instinct tells me so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Oh well, I totally feel reassured now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I will check up on you frequently</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I think you need to do more than check up on me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Such as?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You could, you know, maybe bring chocolate? - helps 
 the nerves</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We shall see</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Will you be back to your green self soon?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Hopefully</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Will I ever get to see the real you again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Hopefully not</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Later that afternoon, Zach sits along on the beach and 
 watches the incoming waves. Gracie makes her way towards him and deliberately 
 keeps her distance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I finally got a hold of Turner and told him the newsvan 
 was swiped - I didn't tell him it was Justine because I'm hoping she 
 ditched it by now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I'm hoping she found Joenne</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Kylee is getting a ride from the cook... and he's driving 
 her home later</p>

<div class="stage">The joke does not tempt Zach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Ooookaaay</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie sits down on the sand near him but still at arm's 
 length.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Just to be clear, are we going to talk about what happened 
 earlier or are we going to pretend that it didn't happen?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I'm leaning towards the latter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> The huge bruise on my ass begs to differ</p>

<div class="stage">This causes Isaacson to cackle like a hyena and bury 
 his face in his hands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I'm glad you think shoving your friend into furniture... 
 cheap, hideous furniture is funny</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> It's not funny... it's payback</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> EXCUSE ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Not for you, for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Shaking her head) I am really lingering in a WTF fog 
 right now - you need to clarify</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Gillian Reuther</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Gillian Who Her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Ruether... my first real girlfriend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Again with the fog, but this time, there's a cold breeze 
 blowing with it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> What happened to me was payback for the way I treated 
 Gillian Ruether and every other mean, nasty, deceitful, dishonest, obnoxious, 
 wrong thing I have ever done in my life</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> What have you been smoking, besides the soot in the 
 air? - I'm going to let you ramble on and, hopefully, I can piece it 
 together after another cup of coffee</p>

<div class="stage">Zach gets up and starts walking along the shore. Gracie 
 reluctantly trails behind.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Back in high school, I wasn't rich, good looking, or 
 a jock...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> No shit?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Because of that, there was a limited dating pool for 
 me to choose from and getting laid was the only real objective</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Mine was to sleep through my classes without getting 
 detention</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Grace - can I focus on my story please?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie motions for him to go on.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Gillian... Gill was the lead clarinet player in the band 
 - I played trombone...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Trom BONE... heh heh heh, sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> She was smart and kind but was also this huge, frumpy 
 cow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Well, you know, we all can't look like Princess Fucking 
 Barbie!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I know... well, I know now - anyway, no one really wanted 
 to hang out with her - on her band jacket, the &quot;G&quot; wore off 
 for some reason and she walked around with &quot;ill&quot; over her 
 pocket</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> COOL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> NOT COOL, why the hell didn't she fix it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Maybe she didn't think it needed fixing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Whatever - it was now my senior year and I had yet to, 
 you know, fuck someone besides myself and half a watermelon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> EWW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> IT WAS HOT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> You have just ruined Midori for me forever</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I knew I had to get some action before the other guys 
 got on my case - we had a bunch of classes together and she was always 
 trying to talk to me - one day, I decided to talk back</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> How oh so very magnanimous of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> My older cousin told me that if I took her out for pizza, 
 she'd probably give it up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> All you guys are such pigs... but it totally worked, 
 didn't it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Like a charm - who knew anchovies were such an aphrodisiac?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie raises her hand and winks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> It was her first time as well - that was a bigger score 
 for me than my Pac-Man high</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Ooh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> But I didn't give a shit about Gill... I said what I 
 needed to say to get me some action and to brag to the other guys about 
 cherry popping - meanwhile, she's making me homemade Valentines and 
 buying me clothes and meals - all the things I thought I was supposed 
 to do for a girlfriend... was she really that desperate?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Growling) Maybe she was just trying to be nice, asshole</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> We went together for almost a year - she would always 
 have these bridal magazines with the pages highlighted and she talked 
 about getting a Golden Retriever</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> She already had one dog, guess she wanted a smarter 
 one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> (Ignoring the dig) I was totally like 'yeah, yeah, whatever 
 makes you happy, babe, now suck my dick'... and she'd swallow, too</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie goes to say something but bites her lip.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> By the time I got to college and filled out more, all 
 of the sudden, there were these horny gorgeous girls who would get drunk 
 and do any guy with a pulse!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Yep, I remember those days... vaguely</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I actually had a girl who was a Miss Hawaiian Tropic 
 contestant - can you believe that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Huh, she must've been really wasted</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> One weekend, Gill surprised me with a visit and saw me 
 with this girl - I was like &quot;Gill who?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Um, yes, that was a sleazy lowball thing to do but 
 I'm still waiting for the strangling kittens part - seriously, Zach, 
 why are you beating yourself up over this now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I haven't finished...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Go on, go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I took glee in verbally assaulting her - she was a huge 
 reminder of what I was before and I was pissed beyond belief that she 
 dare show up in my new life, in front of my new girl, with her hokey 
 homemade cupcakes and her pathetic I LUV U teddy bear - and I told her 
 so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Okay, the heartless dirtbag part is starting to shine 
 now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I screamed so everyone in earshot could hear what an 
 ugly, hairy, walrus she was - I told her that I was just using her for 
 sex and it wasn't even good sex - and, unless she did a complete body 
 transplant, no one would ever love her no matter how many stupid Valentines 
 she made!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Wiping a tear) You win, Eyes... you are indeed one 
 world class piece of sleaze!</p>

<div class="stage">Zach sinks back down to the sand and sighs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Still not done</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> GOOD GOD - what else?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Gill... went back home and hung herself</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie recoils and dry heaves.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> That's the ultimate power, isn't it? - the power to talk
