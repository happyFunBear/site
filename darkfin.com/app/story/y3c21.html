<div class="stage"> WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT...</div>
 
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c01_df_chopper.jpg" h="456" w="810"/>


<div class="stage">The USCG helicopter, carrying Anita, Craig 
 and Darkfin heads towards the massive sea cliff where two dozen hooded 
 figures await their arrival.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Do... do you see them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> My eyes are wide open</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Trying to look at them through his Nightvision 
 scope) Who... WHAT ARE THEY? 
</p>
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c01_craig_nightvision.jpg" h="456" w="510"/>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Starting to perspire) I'm not sure I want to 
 find out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Trying to keep calm) MAYBE... maybe it's some 
 kind of fraternity prank... or, or Sig7 is shooting a scene...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> OR MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST BACK THE HELL OFF</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> GREAT IDEA, LET'S GO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Struggling with her controls) SHIT, WE'RE LOSING 
 POWER</p>

<div class="stage">Lieutenant Fiore tries to bank hard but 
 can't. Warning lights and alarms blare throughout the cockpit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> CAN'T MOVE... DAMN, FISH BITCH, GET OFF OF MY 
 TAIL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Peering down at Darkfin) IS SHE CAUSING THIS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Smacking her dead radio in frustration) I DON'T 
 KNOW BE SHE SURE CAN'T BE HELPING, GET HER OFF</p>

<div class="stage">Craig takes out his handgun and tries to 
 aim it out the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> TRY TO HOLD IT STEADY, ANITA</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> SAVE SOME AMMO FOR THOSE FREAK AHEAD OF US</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, the helicopter jerks violently 
 and zooms forward towards the cliff.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> AAAAHHHHH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> HOLD ON, HOLD ON</p>

<div class="stage">Underneath the helicopter, Aleta Oscura 
 realizes her ride is in serious trouble.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Still staring at the hoods ahead of her) Not 
 playing fair now, are we?</p>

<div class="stage">With trident in hand, Darkfin flips off 
 and lands right into a ring of hoods.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That is alright, I have no intention of playing 
 fair tonight, either</p>

<div class="stage">They instantly surround her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lead Hood</span> (Noticing her color change) 
 Vibrant... but you are still no match for us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Bearing her teeth) We shall see!</p>

<div class="stage">Anita regains control of the helicopter 
 at the last possible second and veers up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> SANTA MARIA, THANK GOD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> GET US OUT OF HERE, FIORE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Trying to guide the helicopter forward) I CAN'T 
 SHAKE LOOSE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> WHY ARE WE JUST HOVERING? - IS DARKFIN STILL HANGING 
 ON?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Scanning out her window) SHE'S DOWN THERE WITH 
 THE OTHERS... OOOWWWW, WHAT THE?</p>

<div class="stage">The lieutenant's left hand is now mysteriously 
 slammed and pinned up against the window, causing both glass and bone 
 to crack. Her bracelet is all aglow.</div>

<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c01_anita_chopper.jpg" h="456" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Bewildered) WHY IS IT DOING THAT? 
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Her wrist now bleeding) AAAHHHH, I CAN'T MOVE 
 IT - DAMMIT - THEY HAVE US IN SOME KIND OF HOLDING PATTERN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Startled at the sight of the hoods) JESUS, THEY'RE 
 GLOWING, TOO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Smelling smoke) THE TORQUE IS GOING TO BLOW THE 
 ENGINE, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> IF WE JUMP FROM THIS HEIGHT, WE'LL DAMAGE SOMETHING 
 FOR SURE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> IF WE DON'T JUMP, WE'RE TOAST - GET READY, CAPTAIN</p>

<div class="stage">On the ground, Darkfin is successfully battling 
 her opponents</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Shifting) ONE</p>

<div class="stage">She breaks the neck of a hood with a quick 
 snap.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Shoving) TWO</p>
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c01_df_fight.jpg" h="456" w="510"/>


<div class="stage">She rams her trident through two others.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Flinging) THREE</p>

<div class="stage">She throws three more off of the cliff.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Checking around) Does anyone really want me 
 to count to ten?</p>

<div class="stage">Off to the side, the Lead Hood is trying 
 desperately to summon Aleta Oscura's trident away from her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lead Hood</span> (Frustrated) I... I don't 
 understand...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Twirling her trident around in a flourish) 
 Try understanding this... I modulated my frequency, now it is time to 
 modulate yours!</p>

<div class="stage">She pitches herself at the Lead Hood and 
 slashes at it with her arm fin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lead Hood</span> (Clutching his shoulder) 
 AARRRGGH... nice move, but it is not enough, it will never be enough</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can deliver a final blow to her 
 enemy, it seemingly disappears into the fog.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I have got to figure out how they do that</p>

<div class="stage">As the fighting takes place, Joenne Mirabello 
 is camouflaged in the hilly fields behind the cliff. She is observing 
 the entire scene in front of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Amazed by Darkfin's presence) 
 UNREAL... this thing keeps getting more and more unreal</p>

<div class="stage">She hastily unpacks several gear bags while 
 speaking into a communication device.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> ALL UNITS, ALL UNITS, GRID TANGO 
 FIVE - CODE BLACK, REPEAT CODE BLACK... I'm going to be hurting here, 
 boys, you better come on through for me!</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne suddenly notices the glowing eyes 
 of a pair of hoods trained directly on her. They alert the others and 
 all of them now switch their sole focus to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Gasping) Uh-oh</p>

<div class="stage">They begin to float in her direction.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Quickly assembling a rocket 
 launcher) UH-OH</p>

<div class="stage">Meanwhile, still hovering directly above 
 the chaos, Anita and Craig prepare to jump from the helicopter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> READY...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> SET...</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne takes aim at the group of hoods.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> FIRE</p>
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c01_joenne_rocket.jpg" h="548" w="460"/>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Jumping) GOOOO</p>

<div class="stage">The rocket blasts off of Joenne's shoulder 
 but instead of hitting her target, the hoods somehow manage to deflect 
 it into the helicopter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> NOOOO</p>

<div class="stage">It explodes into a fireball as Craig and 
 Anita tumble to the ground. The captain is knocked unconscious while 
 Anita lands in a bush. The explosion, giving Joenne an opportunity to 
 retreat, momentarily stuns the remaining hoods.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Wracked with pain) CRAIG, CRAIG, COME ON, GET 
 UP</p>

<div class="stage">As she crawls over to her captain, a hooded 
 figure stands before her with a large, ornate dagger.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Holding up her arm in defense) AAAYYYY</p>

<div class="stage">The hooded figure freezes at the sight of 
 her bracelet. As it starts to back away, it backs right into the prongs 
 of Darkfin's trident.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Pushing the skewered hood off of it with her 
 foot) Always look behind you</p>

<div class="stage">For a brief moment, Darkfin and Anita stare 
 at each other. The lieutenant notices that her bracelet is now glowing 
 a same eerie green color as Aleta Oscura's weapon.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Grabbing the hood's dagger) YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Glancing at the motionless Craig) Help will 
 be here shortly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> WAIT A MINUTE</p>

<div class="stage">Disobeying the request, Darkfin runs and 
 twirls in the air, sending herself over the cliff and back into the 
 ocean.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> NOW WHAT?</p>

<div class="stage">The ground abruptly begins to shake.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">On the other side of town, Brad Martel and 
 Penny Renselier hold on for dear life as the building tumbles down around 
 them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Covering his head and hers) NO, STAY IN THE DOORWAY, 
 STAY IN THE DOORWAY</p>

<div class="stage">Penny screams as it turns pitch dark in 
 the store. Boxes and bricks continue to fly in every direction. Moments 
 later, the ruckus dies down and Brad lights the dusty air with a glow 
 stick from one of his product lines.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Grabbing her face) Pen, are you OK?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trying not to cry but unable to do so) Yeah... 
 I think</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> LOOK AT THIS PLACE... or what's left of it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Brad...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Kicking a brick) What's the sense of restocking 
 when WE DON'T HAVE A BUILDING ANYMORE - WE'VE CLOSED BEFORE WE EVEN 
 OPENED</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> BRAD - WHERE ARE AMY AND THAT NEWS CHICK?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Huh?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Shrieking) WHERE DID THEY GO?</p>

<div class="stage">The two now turn their attention to a giant 
 pile of rubble before them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Oh, man!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Holding herself) You don't think?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Running over to it) START DIGGING</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Drifting in an out of some kind of stupor, 
 Morrigan McBride realizes that she is stumbling along a dirt path with 
 Amethyst Hill, still naked and still leading the way.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Distorted vision) Look at all the pretty beads 
 hanging... just hanging</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Those are grapes, Honey, we're in a vineyard</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Opening her mouth) I want some</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Maybe we'll get you some of the liquid kind 
 later, keep moving</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Wide eyed) Why are we here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Pointing to the city lights in the distance) 
 Because you don't want to be over there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You're worse than the three year-old down the 
 street, keep moving!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Holding her head) I can't... I can't get my 
 balance</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Neither can anyone else in the entire valley 
 right now... including the cops, keep moving</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Fixating on her glowing crystal) Ooh, pretty</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Pushing away Morri's hand) Don't touch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why are you doing this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Pausing and looking directly at her friend 
 and tenant) Because it's necessary... YOU are necessary</p>

<div class="stage">With that, she once again pulls a dazed 
 Morrigan along and they head into a labyrinth of tunnels under the Quartz 
 Lake Inn.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Anguished) Ouch, my leg, I can't walk on it 
 much longer</p>

<div class="stage">Amy stares down at Morrigan's glowing and 
 profusely bleeding foot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Lean more on me, we're just around the corner...</p>

<div class="stage">Doing so, Morrigan is barely able to make 
 out her surroundings. She does recognize a wine cellar and a small cot 
 in the corner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Setting her down and lighting some candles) 
 Rest here, I'll be right back</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Panicked) Where... where are you going 
 to?</p>
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c01_morri_amy.jpg" h="455" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I'm getting something for your foot</p>

<div class="stage">Minutes pass by as Morrigan tries to focus 
 her eyes on the bottles of wine before her. As promised, Amy returns 
 with a first aid kit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Disappointed) No magical mudpack and leaf 
 treatment?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Wrapping the foot) Not this time, I'm afraid... 
 this, however, should stop the bleeding</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It no longer burns... thank you</p>

<div class="stage">The light to Amy's crystal begins to lose 
 intensity.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You'll be safe for awhile, Morri - rest, recuperate...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you leaving again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (With a somber smile) I need to find Roshumba</p>

<div class="stage">Amy brings over a flask of water and covers 
 Morrigan with a blanket.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> She will come for you here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Roshumba?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Not quite</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You'll know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Try to stay quiet</p>

<div class="stage">Covering herself with the other blanket, 
 Amy heads out the way they came in.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> 'Bye bye, Fairy Godmother</p>

<div class="stage">Under a desk in the KCON newsroom, Zachary 
 Isaacson and Justine Mirabello are busy looking for Gracie when the 
 earthquake hits. They ride it out under a desk. After a few moments, 
 they peek out at the even more disheveled newsroom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> THAT was big</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I've had bigger</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> We better stay here in case of an aftershock</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> What if that was the FORESHOCK?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Rubbing his head) ALWAYS THE OPTIMIST, JUSTI</p>

<div class="stage">Zach slowly gets to his feet and calls across 
 the floor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> GRACIE... DAMMIT, FINGERS, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE 
 YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> You STILL haven't told me how my sister is mixed 
 up in this mess with McBride and Father Freaky - and I'm not leaving 
 UNTIL you do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Getting up) I promise, I'll tell you everything 
 I know - but, right now, we need to find Takanachi - she said she was 
 here at Morri's cube, let's go!</p>

<div class="stage">As they get to the empty cubicle, the entire 
 floor erupts into a stampede of KCON workers, including Kylee Shepperton.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Rolling her eyes and sighing) ISAACSON, YOU SPEND 
 MORE TIME HERE THAN YOU DO AT YOUR REAL JOB</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Serious) Kylee, have you seen Gracie?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Do I look like her social calendar?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> You look like someone's little black book</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> And your business here is what, Justine?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'm serious, Shepperton, HAVE YOU SEEN GRACIE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Tilting her head) NO, I HAVE NOT - and she better 
 get her fat ass in here, with everything that's going on, we're understaffed, 
 no thanks to your fugitive pal McBride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> FUGITIVE, what are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Maybe if your did your JOB, you'd know 
 what's going on

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Raising an eyebrow) WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> WHAT ELSE HAPPENED BESIDES THE EARTHQUAKE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Oh, not all that much... just lawmen unleashing 
 the hounds on KCON's former fuzzy bunny girl, an explosion of some kind 
 by the bay involving the Coast Guard, ooh, and it's coming over the 
 wire now that Karl von Meer suffered a massive heart attack - is that 
 enough?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> DEAR GOD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Now, if you both will excuse me, I have a job 
 to do - you might want to call your paper and see if you still have 
 one, Zachary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Taking off like a shot) I HAVE GOT TO FIND 
 MY SISTER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Also taking off) I NEED TO FIND GRACIE</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Yeah, they happen to OTHER PEOPLE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Clutching his shoulder) We'll know for 
 sure after the post mortem</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Jumping up) NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT, I WILL NOT 
 HAVE HIM CARVED UP LIKE... LIKE A SIDE OF BEEF</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> We need to determine...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> I WANT TO SEE HIM NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> When we were working on him... we opened 
 his chest to keep his heart beating - there's a lot of blood</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Ready to throw up) Oh, dad!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Trembling) I DON'T CARE, I WANT TO SEE HIM</p>

 the glass until he's properly cleaned up</p>

 and lets them spend a few minutes grieving. She excuses herself and

 corner. After they finally step away the viewing area, Dr. Stephanie 
 carefully wheels the body of Karl senior into another room down the 
 hall. He is still breathing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Administering some medication) I'm sorry 
 I had to do that to your family, Karl, but someone tried to poison you... 
 and almost succeeded</p>

<div class="stage">She takes his hand in hers and gently rubs 
 it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Until I figure out who that person 
 is, it's best that everyone thinks you're dead</p>
