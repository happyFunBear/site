<div class="stage">With Eliza Carthy's &quot;Angels &amp; Cigarettes&quot; CD softly playing, Morrigan McBride rushes around her house in her underwear, laying out clothes and brushing her teeth. She glances at the screen of her laptop and slams it shut.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Spitting toothpaste) You BETTER be there</p>

<div class="stage">She finishes up in the bathroom and returns to her bed. She begins to dress, first slipping on black jeans and then a black turtleneck. The phone interrupts Morrigan's thoughts and she reluctantly presses the speakerphone button.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hello?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Where the fuck are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hi, Gracie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That didn't answer my question</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Use your journalistic powers of deduction</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You're home, that's pretty obvious - why are you bailing on dinner with me and Zach again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, that's tomorrow night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Now getting on the phone) No, that's tonight, M&amp;M</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> We said Wednesday night at 9:00</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Right time, wrong day</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her forehead) Damn, I'm so sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No problem, just get over here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking out a ski mask) I can't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Curt tone) Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh, I don't feel that well - it's my time of the month</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> How convenient</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not kidding Gracie, you want to come over here and check? - SHUDDUP, ZACH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I didn't say anything!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It was a preemptive strike</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Smart</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Now taking out some black gloves) Listen, I know that new sci-fi flick is supposed to open this week - we'll all go, my treat</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Don't try to buy us off, McBride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Can we get jumbo popcorns and Cookie Dough Bits?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Seriously, I want to do this, I'll even invite KJ along - I promise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Disgusted) Fine, I'll see you at work tomorrow... hopefully</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> How about drinks after the movie, will you spring for that as well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Don't press your luck, Eyes - see you later</p>

<div class="stage">After clicking off, Morrigan laces up her black sneakers and straps a black chronograph on her wrist. She sets the time and tinkers with some other buttons.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing her stomach) Ugh</p>

<div class="stage">After taking a few deep breaths, she shuts everything down and throws on a black trench coat. In the pockets, she stuffs the ski mask, the gloves, a mini camera, some other electronic equipment, and a serrated folding knife.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Tapping on the terrarium) You be a good girl, T - enjoy your grasshopper, I'm off to deal with another intriguing creature right now... I wonder if I should bring her some worms?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan steps out of her house and makes her way to her car. She is startled by a figure on the lawn.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Did someone die?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Amy, what are you doing there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Connecting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> With what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> The universe</p>

<div class="stage">Amethyst Hill is sitting cross-legged on the lawn with a bunch of crystals and candles set up before her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Does the universe need me to pick up some brown rice from the store?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> OH YEAH, COULD YOU? - the universe would me most grateful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Studying Morrigan's attire) KJ left you some flowers yesterday, is this a time of mourning?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Reluctantly approaching) No, no one died - it's actually a time of the month for me NOT to wear white</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You're taking it to an extreme, don't you think?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's a quirk I have</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Raising an eyebrow) One of many</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Speaking of which, what exactly are you... I dunno... performing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I am NOT a witch, I am a practitioner of alternative faiths and healings</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh, OK - anyway, what is this ceremony?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Looking up) There is a Venus-Neptune trine right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sarcastic) Really? - can I tape it and watch it later?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Um, no - but you can help me make blueberry mead when you return</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not sure when I'll be back</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Off to do some research?</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c10_amy_ritual.jpg" h="491" w="470"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You could say that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Try not to get wet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Opening her car door) Heh, I have my raincoat</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Morrigan... be careful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting in) Did the stars or the stones tell you to tell me that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Blowing out a candle) My gut</p>

<hr>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c10_meeramar_building.jpg" h="475" w="327"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">Taking a circuitous route to the Meeramar corporate headquarters, a modern metal and glass 12-story building overlooking Duquesa Bay, Morrigan parks behind some bushes about a mile down the road. Slipping on her ski mask and gloves, she gets out of the car and slowly advances toward the building. Suddenly, a force from behind grabs her and covers her mouth.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Struggling) MMMmmmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> We need to work on your reaction time</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan flings the green scaly arms off of her and spins around in an angry huff.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I believe the bank is down the road</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Lifting up her ski mask) Would it kill you to use a simple salutation instead of a wrestling hold?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I enjoy being unique</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No kidding?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Are you ready?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes - now, see that guard down there? - I'll distract him while you do the rest... NO KILLING - just knock him out and we'll hide him behind that concrete planter. Next, you'll climb up the building, find some kind of opening on the roof, and make your way inside</p>

<div class="stage">Staring at the smaller woman, Darkfin says nothing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Holding up some equipment) Once inside, you will use this - I borrowed it from the boys in KCON's A/V department - it will trick the security cameras into a time loop... just hook up these cords and press this button</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> And what will you be doing, trying your best to look inconspicuous?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll be waiting at the side entrance, come get me once the camera loop is established - we'll have exactly 30 minutes to do what we need to do</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan rummages through her pockets.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Here, strap on this watch so we'll be in perfect sync</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin continues to stand there with her arms folded.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Take it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I do not need a watch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh, I don't mean to insult your time-telling super power but I would feel more secure if you wore it</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c10_df_waiting.jpg" h="455" w="370"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">Darkfin turns around and strides off to the complex with an angry Morrigan trailing behind.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Seriously, I have everything timed down to the second</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I thought you were deficient with number comprehension?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I can count!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Keep your watch, Ms. McBride, and your camera equipment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND - I DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT</p>

<div class="stage">They now pause on a grassy slope near the side entrance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You will not be caught, I can assure you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> If you don't like my plan, FINE - tell me exactly how we're going to get inside? - maybe you like hurling your trident... where is it by the way... and leaving a trail of bloody bodies behind, I just want to go in peacefully and check out some files - no heroics, no emergency service personnel, no...mmmMMM</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin covers the woman's mouth again and holds up a Meeramar key card.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> There will be no need to harm the guard, scale the building, or use your video gizmo - this card bypasses it all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hrrrmpdummattt?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Withdrawing her hand) I apologize</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How did your get that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You are not the only one with sources</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Scuffing her foot) Damn, I went through all of that planning for nothing!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It was a valuable mental exercise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> GO TO HELL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I am there with you already</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Quietly) What do you mean?</p>

<div class="stage">With one deft move, Morrigan is thrown down hard on the ground with Aleta Oscura covering her body, hands gripped around her throat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Taking deep breaths) It is taking every ounce of will power I have right now to keep from snapping your neck</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Gasping) Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Bearing her teeth) It is your time of the month, is it not?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Eh... how... yes?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Now in her ear) The same instinct that can sense it is also the same one that commands me to kill and feed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trembling) Dear God</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin quickly jumps up and hurries off to the entrance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Swiping the key card) Come along, Ms. McBride!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan reluctantly follows.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself) I knew I should have brought some worms</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Riding in his silver Lexus, Griffin Martel answers his cell phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes, father - I understand - no, you will not be disappointed... in fact, I think I'll swing back to the office and recheck some figures - I will, goodbye</p>

<div class="stage">He swings the car into a quick u-turn and rides back to the Meeramar HQ. Now inside Griffin's office, Morrigan quickly searches through his files, snapping pictures with her minicam and speaking mental notes into a dictaphone. Darkfin stands off to the side, keeping watch.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Reading a brochure) HA, I knew it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> This type of machinery is not used for oil - he's drilling for metal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> The proper term is &quot;mining&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Slamming down the papers) &quot;Drilling,&quot; &quot;mining,&quot; &quot;scooping out with his digits&quot; - it doesn't matter!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> For someone whose profession it is to be a wordsmith, I would highly think it would matter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I can't believe I'm being lectured by the seafood special</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> What do you think he is mining for?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The same stuff your pitchfork is made out of, the same stuff that's supposedly in my blood... Nereidium</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That is a valid assumption - why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can you imagine the weapons of mass destruction that can be made from this and the gazillion dollars of profit to go along with it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I do not need to imagine those scenarios... they haunt my thoughts in the day and my dreams during the night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You need to tell me more</p>

<div class="stage">Aleta Oscura goes over to a global map on the wall.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> There are only three known veins of Nereidium in the world - two are buried so deep, it would take centuries to reach them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What about the third?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Facing her) It can be reached within the year</p>

<div class="stage">The sudden sound of approaching footsteps causes the two of them to freeze. Griffin Martel is now outside his office door. After entering his security code, he ambles inside and notices the mess of files on his desk. He slowly goes over to it and slams his fist down.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Exasperated) GOD DAMN YOU, DAD, STOP CHECKING UP ON ME - I CAN DO THIS</p>

<div class="stage">Carefully positioned on the ceiling overhead is Darkfin with Morrigan clinging to her back. They stay as silent and as still as they possibly can.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c10_df_mm_ceiling.jpg" h="437" w="520"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Dialing his phone) Rikka... please pick up if you're there - look, I would really appreciate your thoughts on something - and... and I also need to see you, you're the only one who... you know... I don't know... I love you - please call me back when you get this message</p>

<div class="stage">He hangs up in disgust and places another call as Darkfin tenses up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> KJ, it's Griffin - do you know where your sister is? - why am I not surprised... listen, do you have some time, I could use a hand with some Meeramar business - no, I don't want your father involved - can't Ona Rosa work on that issue herself?</p>

<div class="stage">It is now Morrigan's turn to tense up. She can tell Darkfin is starting to lose her grip from the extra weight.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Look, Kage, I'm not asking, I'm TELLING you to get your ass over here right now - no, you DO NOT have time to drop by Morrigan's house for a quick visit... I don't CARE how long you haven't seen her - quite frankly, I'm rather disappointed in Ms. McBride, I thought she would be more of a challenge, journalistically speaking - I'll see you in ten!</p>

<div class="stage">As Griffin bangs down his phone, Morrigan drops down from the ceiling and pulls a stunned Griffin into a headlock. Darkfin is just as stunned.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Deep, gruff voice) OK, RICH BOY, HAND OVER YOUR WATCH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Squirming) TRY AND TAKE IT, FUCKER</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan knees him in the kidney and pulls out her knife.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Holding it to his throat) DON'T MAKE ME CUT YOU</p>

<div class="stage">She motions to Darkfin to knock out the window. Aleta Oscura does so as Morrigan snatches Griffin's platinum Movado and takes off his tie. She blindfolds him with it, and binds his hands and feet with the telephone cord. Morrigan now grabs his wallet and empties the cash out of it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Same voice) You call the cops on me and you're a dead man!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan holds on for dear life, piggyback, to Darkfin as they climb down the side of the building. Hopping to the ground, the two start to run.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Truth be told, you had no intention of finding out about the Nereidium, you just want an accomplice in crime</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yeah, I figured a cold-blooded killer would make a dandy side-kick - you were about to fall, I had to do something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Your quick thinking was fairly impressive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Don't worry, I'm donating the money to charity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> What about the watch?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Smirking) I'll have to think about that</p>

<div class="stage">Aleta Oscura suddenly stops and scans around. She runs off, leaps, and glides up to the building's corner and remains out of sight.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What are you doing?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin motions for her to be quiet. The security guard from earlier now stands before Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I KNEW we should have taken him out earlier</p>

<div class="stage">The guard draws his gun but looks past Morrigan. She turns around to see three, hooded figures directly in back of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> AW, MAN</p>

<div class="stage">Before the guard can fire, he is sent hurtling into a tree by one of the figures. The other two grab Morrigan and throw her into the Meeramar fountain but not before taking her trench coat and vanishing as quickly as they appeared.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sitting up and spitting water) NOT AGAIN</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin comes over and helps her up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHERE IN THE HELL WERE YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Observing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Giving her the middle finger) OBSERVE THIS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Sometimes, you need to study your enemy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why are they doing this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> They are testing you... your resolve</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (On the verge of tears) They took everything - this whole evening was a WASTE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Not entirely - you now have confirmation of your suspicions, it is time to do further research and formulate several plans of action</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Plans you will undoubtedly be a part of</p>

<div class="stage">The sound of KJ's voice echoes across the way.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> DUDE, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?</p>

<div class="stage">He rushes over to the unconscious security guard as Darkfin quickly leads Morrigan away. The two are now back by the hidden white Mustang.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Go home and rest, stay warm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I need to pick up some brown rice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Tomorrow is another day</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Of dementia... despite what happened, I really appreciated your help tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It is now your turn to help me when I need it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grimacing) More tests?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Yes - I shall contact you soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I take it I can't tell anyone about my Nereidum knowledge yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That would be correct</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can I at least tell my tarantula?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You need to leave now before the police arrive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Cops, why not make this a total party?</p>

<div class="stage">There is a long, uncomfortable silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Starting the engine) Let's go, I'll drive you back to the beach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> NO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It is not safe for either one of us to spend anymore time together tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why, do you think the hoods are coming back?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin stares intently at a bleeding scrape on Morrigan's hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Turning and leaving) They would be the least of your concerns</p>
