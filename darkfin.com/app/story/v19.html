<div class="stage">Erika von Meer's two fellow colleagues from Scripps relax outside of their Indian Ocean Marine Institute dorms, waiting for
    their friend to arrive.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> (Scowling at her watch) Looks like we're going to be a twosome again
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> (Scratching his leg) She's probably at SAMMY'S place
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> Don't say it like that, they're probably just obsessed with their experiments, you know how Rikka
    gets when she's on the verge of proving a theory
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> I'm pretty sure she did... weeks ago - I overhead Dr. Da Silva chatting away about some rat in the
    lab with fish scales growing all over its tail
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> That would explain why some of the major pharmaceutical companies have sent recon scouts over here
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> Sorry, that just pisses me off - OUR studies are just as important and yet you don't see OUR professors
    inviting us to their homes or drug pushers hovering over OUR heads
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> (Slight smirk) Speak for yourself
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> HEY
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> The lab tech and I had a private little party at his apartment the other night
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> You slut!
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> I know and he was good, too
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> Think von Meer has her own special Sri Lankan slurpie?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> When? - she's always working with Dr. Ranasinghe
</p>
<div class="stage">Colleague 2 twitches both of his eyebrows in unison.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> (Snapping him with her hat) YOU PIG - why do you men always want to go there?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> Because... we can... because... we want to... because it's warm and gooey and...
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> Enough already - shh, here comes Erika
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> HEY RIK
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Casually walking over) Hey, you two
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> How's it going?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Distant) Good, good - are you done with your field testing?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> Later this week
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Ah
</p>

<div class="stage">There is an uncomfortable silence.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> Listen, we were thinking about hitting some of the dance clubs later tonight, want to come along?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I can't, Sam and I are going sailing today, we'll be out pretty late
</p>
<div class="stage">Both colleagues shoot glances at each other.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Aware of their look) We need to do some deep-water experiments, it's complicated
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> (Slightly sarcastic) Of course
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> You two need to watch yourselves
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> Pay no attention to him, he's just being a goof - I'm sure your relationship with Dr. Ranasinghe
    is completely innocent
</p>
<div class="stage">The blonde is silent for a second and then blinks.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I was talking about the riots in the eastern provinces, there will probably be a state-ordered curfew in
    effect - I don't want to have to convince the American consulate to bail out your sorry butts again
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> Oh... right
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> That was only ONE time and we were only SLIGHTLY drunk
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> We had no idea that was a religious icon, honestly, we didn't!
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> It was worth it just to see the look on Da Silva's face
</p>
<div class="stage">All three chuckle as a bikini-clad Samadara enters the courtyard and walks over to the threesome.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Smiling) Sorry to interrupt... Erika, are you ready to go?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Picking up her sack) Absolutely - I'll see you two later
</p>
<div class="stage">The colleagues wave and watch the two women leave.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> Yeah... they're really going to be doing scientific stuff on a boat in bikinis - heh, I wish I had
    my camcorder
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> You are such a sleaze... although, I will admit that it seems rather odd - she didn't even try to
    argue our suspicions
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 2</span> Rikka used to be such a party girl, she never would have passed up clubbing before
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Colleague 1</span> Whatever, we'll all be out of this pit in a few more weeks, c'mon, let's go!
</p>
<div class="stage">As Erika looks behind her and watches her friends take off in a Jeep, Samadara gently touches her arm and nods towards the
    small sailboat.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Would you prefer to go with them? - we can always do this another time
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> No, our work needs to be finished - my play days are over with
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> They don't have to be
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I want them to be - now, if you don't mind, Dr. Ranasinghe, we really should be on our way
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Squeezing her shoulder) So serious - do you realize you lapse into formality whenever you are put on the
    defensive?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Ignoring her) Please take the helm, I'll manage the sail
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> It's a way of being cold and distant, keeping human emotion suppressed
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Untying the ropes) I didn't know you were teaching a psych class?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Helping out) In order for you to face the challenges ahead, Eri, you mustn't be so rigid
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Clenching her jaw) Are we ready to go now?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Are you?
</p>
<div class="stage">The two set sail and spend about three hours in open waters, conducting a variety of strenuous experiments. As the afternoon
    sun begins to diminish, an exhausted Erika stretches out on the deck.

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> It's Griffin's birthday today
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Writing in her log book) Do you wish to be with him?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Absently) No... in fact, I don't want to go home
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> You've already requested a three-month extension, I'm sure Dr. Da Silva will grant it to you
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> No, I mean I don't want to leave here... ever
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> I know my country is beautiful but...
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't want to leave IOMI... or you
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> But your family is in California
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't care
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> It is important for you to continue your experiments
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I can get my doctorate here
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> But we're not equipped for what you will eventually need
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> We'll figure that out when the time comes!
</p>
<div class="stage">Samadara puts down her book and takes a seat next to her pupil.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Noticing the tan lines) You're starting to burn
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> It's only skin, right?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Applying some sunblock) This will take away the sting
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> What takes away the sting for you?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Carefully rubbing her back) It never goes away, really - you're just born used to it
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Turning around and facing her mentor) May I see it again?
</p>
<div class="stage">Samadara sighs and ponders the query.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking her hand) Please?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Go ahead
</p>
<div class="stage">Using her fingertips, Erika slowly pulls off Samadara's shell bracelet, exposing the circular marking underneath.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Tracing the outline of the symbol) It's exquisite... I want to see it glow
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Pulling back) It only changes when it is in contact with another source
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I still don't understand the whole thing
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> You will soon enough
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> You keep telling me this and yet I barely know how to spell Nereidium
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Once your marine transgenic studies are complete, we can shift your sole focus to this
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> My studies ARE complete - well, nearly - with your help over these last few months, theories that I thought
    would takes years, even decades to prove, have now been solved in weeks
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> I know
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Dr. Da Silva wants to trumpet it to the scientific world, he's talking Nobel Prize
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Arjuna is an eager ass - he has no conception of the significance of your findings - they are not ready for
    public consumption
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I am aware of this
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> I will handle him... you need to be able to handle the Nereidium

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> If you teach me, I will learn

    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Looking off over the waves) We'll drop anchor here, the cove is not that far
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Cove?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Getting ready to dive into the water) Come, there is a beach I want to take you to
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking at the sky) It'll be dark soon, are you sure?

<div class="stage">She is answered by the sound of a splash.

    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Following) Alrighty

<div class="stage">The two arrive on the shore where a solitary torch is lit.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> How do you feel?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Squinting her eyes and trying to catch her breath) A little dizzy, I think I got too much sun today
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Actually, it's because of this location... you're standing directly above one of the three veins
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> This is where the Nereidium is?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Yes... the vein here is very weak but accessible - the one off the coast of Western Ireland is strong but
    nearly impossible to get to...
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> And the one in Duquesa Bay?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> Strong... and easily accessible - now do you understand the importance of returning to your home?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking away) I'm starting to

<div class="stage">Samadara reaches around Erika's shoulder and offers a warm embrace.
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Scanning around) What exactly is this place?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> It was a ceremonial beach used by the Veddhas
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Veddhas?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> The island's native aboriginal inhabitants - they dwelt in the forest but would come here once a year to
    worship
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Worship what?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Sam</span> (Thin smile) I'll be right back
</p>
<div class="stage">Running into the surf, Dr. Ranasinghe disappears into the waves. Erika starts to panic after five minutes and is about to
    go in after her when Sam resurfaces. With the mark now aglow on her wrist, she makes her way towards the shore with trident
    in hand.
