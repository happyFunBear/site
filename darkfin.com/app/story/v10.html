<div class="stage">On the outskirts between Duquesa Bay and Chaparral Heights, lies The Jade Gate Bar. A small, stand-alone establishment with blacked out windows nestled in back of an automotive center. Lieutenant Anita Fiore drags a reluctant Captain Craig Phelps inside after work.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/jade_gate.jpg" h="231" w="520"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Trying to hide his face) I can't believe you made me come in here, Anita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Why? - you made me suffer through &quot;Caribou O'Callahan's&quot; last week</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Taking a seat at the bar) You play gigs there!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Joining him) That's different... I get PAID to endure it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Rubbing his fingers) Where's my payment?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Smiling at the athletic, short-haired female bartender) I got your first drink... one Heineken and one club soda, por favor!</p>

<div class="stage">The bartender returns the smile and presents the drinks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm telling you, Craig, we need to put a 24-hour tail on McBride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'm guessing you'd volunteer to be that tail</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Look, I'm serious here - if she didn't have us by the curlies with that illegal fishing boat bit, she would have led us right to Aleta Oscura, I know it... Crunch, are you listening to me?</p>

<div class="stage">The captain's expression is one of shock as he watches 
 a man enter the establishment. It is George Renselier and he quickly 
 sits at a corner table occupied by Tim Hajanian.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I don't... I don't believe what I'm seeing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Following his stare) OH, C'MON - like you didn't know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> HOW WOULD I KNOW, ANITA?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Everyone in town knows, even your fellow breeders</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> But... he's our assemblyman</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> And?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> He's married with a kid</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> AND?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Sighing) That's just pathetic, I'm sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> But it's OK for you to screw Martel's wife?</p>

<div class="stage">Craig answers by silently sipping his club soda.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Who's the guy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You don't recognize him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> He seems familiar but I can't quite make him out in this lighting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> One hint - SCU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Wait a minute... is that Hajanian, Sandy and Erika's toadie?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Clinking her glass) WE HAVE A WINNER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Oh man, poor Lydia and Penny</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm sure they know as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I just... I'm sorry - that's just WRONG - say what you will about me but I'm not an elected official hiding behind a wife and child</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Picking at some peanuts) No, you only represent the United States military... well, partially - you divorced your wife and see your kid two months a year</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Anita, I am not getting into this with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Think of it this way - you now have new leverage with our dear district honcho</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I would NEVER do that to someone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> And that's why you'll stay a captain for the next decade</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> At least I'll be a captain with integrity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I wonder if Doug the Elder would agree with that statement?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Yeah, he's a prime example of probity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Here's an idea... let's shut our mouths and play &quot;YMCA&quot; on the jukebox</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Let's just change the subject... how's your sister doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You mean the other married woman you're hung up on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I could ask about your folks instead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Oni is doing fine - she and Sandy might be taking a vacation soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Together?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah, I'm thinking more likely than not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> The kids too?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Draining her beer) We didn't get that far into it - I quickly changed the subject back to me</p>

<div class="stage">Craig is staring at a man seated on the other side of the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Discretely) Him again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Who are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That guy in the corner with the Dumbo ears - I think he's staring at me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Sighing) Jesus, Crunch, just because you're in a place like this doesn't mean every guy is going to hit on you... of course, the uniform isn't helping</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> No, I mean I've seen him before - I think he's following me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (To the bartender) Did you put anything in his club soda?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Looking at his watch) Ooh, I gotta take off... thankfully</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Patting his back) Be sure to give Ursula my very best... literally!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'll see you tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> With a smile on your face... later, Cap!</p>

<div class="stage">As he leaves, Anita notices the man with the ears follow him out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Huh - I wonder what that's about? - hey bartender, have you seen that guy in here before... the one that was in the corner with the huge ears?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Bartender</span> Sorry, I didn't really notice - I was too busy watching the scene at table six</p>

<div class="stage">Anita follows her stare to George and Tim.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Rolling her eyes) Cue the Dave Koz CD</p>

<div class="stage">The distinguished older man finishes a conversation on his cell phone while his younger companion picks at the label on his empty beer bottle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Yes, that is absolutely doable - be sure to get with the committee on that and let me know what happens, I'll see you tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Sighing) Are you free now, Geo?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Sorry, Timothy, you know how it goes</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2v10_george.jpg" h="429" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> No, not really</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Just say the word and I can turn you on to real business in no time - you need to build a solid financial portfolio</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> You sound like my dad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I'm only thinking of your future - something that selling statues at art fairs or dissecting fish won't provide</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> YOU ARE NOT MY DAD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Please lower you voice... we do not need unnecessary attention</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> YOU have the problem with attention, I don't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Listen, I was thinking we could take a drive up to Napa this weekend?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I thought you had some kind of function with Lydia?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> It was cancelled out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I'm so glad to be your back-up plan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Holding his hand) Timmy, don't be this way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> How else am I supposed to be? - I've seen you all of twice in the last month</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Things are very busy right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Uh-huh - I have things going on in MY life as well - have you even asked me about my latest research?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I'm sorry - seaweed, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> MOLLUSKS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Right... I think Penny is doing a paper on something like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER, MAN, AND NEITHER DO YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Angered) That is NOT true - she is the one GOOD thing in my life - we may not be &quot;The Cleavers&quot; but Lydia and Penelope mean everything to me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Sarcastic laugh) I think I just got my answer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> There was never a question, Timothy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Taking out a pack of cigarettes) I'm thinking of going back east, maybe even out of the country for my PhD</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2v10_tim_mad.jpg" h="437" w="470"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Taken aback) I... I thought the department at SCU offered what you needed?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> It does... but you don't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Look, I'm sorry for being so distant lately - let's meet up for a bike ride tomorrow afternoon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> WHAT? - you think a quick jerk-off in the park is going to make everything better?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> That's NOT what I'm implying</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Could have fooled me - it's been over a year, George, I'm getting tired of being your toy boy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> You knew going in what the situation was</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Getting up) Yeah, and I had mistakenly thought that you had grown to love me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I DO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Taking off) WHATEVER - TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER BIKE RIDING TOMORROW</p>

<div class="stage">And with that, Tim Hajanian runs out and slams the door of the bar. Anita chuckles to herself as a dazed George Renselier slumps back in his chair. She does not notice as Marcy Nolan takes a seat next to her at the bar.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Low voice) A real soap opera</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Glancing back) Yeah... HEY</p>

<div class="stage">Anita nearly chokes on her beer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Nice to see you again, lieutenant</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking around) I think you and your fiance might be slightly more comfortable at T.G.I. Friday's</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Ned is back in Melbourne</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2v10_anita.jpg" h="573" w="370"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Is that so?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> He'll return in a few weeks after his rock-climbing trip</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> So, are you trolling for someone to climb you in his absence?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Half laugh) Actually, I have a two-hour break from shooting - I wanted a whiskey sour, nothing more</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Eyeing her up and down) Right... Jamie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Miffed) I'd sincerely appreciate it if you could separate fact from fantasy and call me by my real name... Marcy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Softening slightly) Marcy it is... although you gotta know that people's gut reaction is to call you &quot;Jamie&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Scowling at her drink) I haven't played that character in years</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> But she was... is adored by everyone - you were a large part of my childhood, every Thursday night from 8:30 to 9:00</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> So I've been told</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Wow, and I thought I dripped with resentment when I spoke</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Let's just say my memories of &quot;Life's Little Lessons&quot; are not as fond as yours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Calling for another beer) Yep, I can see where big money and fame just ruins a good time!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Your life is never your own</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Hmm, it must be difficult for someone whose sole employment is based on playing other people</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> You fans think it's so easy!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah? - is it harder than sitting on your ass doing spreadsheets all day for a company that screws you every chance it gets? - is it harder than waiting on rude people who will stiff you with no tip because you didn't bring the butter fast enough? - I don't need to hear you whine, lady!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> OK, try this - as a child, your parents basically whore you out to this TV show because you're cute and you can make more in six months than what your father brings home in six years - meanwhile, you're forced to grow up too quickly, there are no such things as real school or friends, everything revolves around learning your lines and hitting your marks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> GIMME A BREAK - believe me, school was no picnic - the kids in elementary made fun of me and my sister because we were so poor at one point, we had to wait at the end of the cafeteria line to get the free lunches - in junior high, I had teachers of both sexes hitting on me - in high school, I was constantly being beat up and was banned from my prom because I wanted to bring a girl... oh, and there are these little things called &quot;tests&quot; that can annihilate your self esteem for years - so, Miss Actress, you didn't miss much, not much at all!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> I'm sorry your scholastic experience was on the down side, I have heard other stories that were the complete opposite of yours... besides, you didn't let me finish</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2v10_marcy.jpg" h="442" w="470"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> By all means, please go on - tell me how doing a photo shoot for Vogue can be such a total bummer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Tell me, did you enjoy the interaction between &quot;Jamie&quot; and her sister &quot;Jenny?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> AY - I LIVED FOR IT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Yep, you and the LLL writers - unhappy with their own lives, these twisted fucks deliberately created subtext between my character and my &quot;sister&quot; and then blamed the resulting sexual tension on something conveniently called &quot;duality&quot; - the sicko producers saw it and ran with it, they dressed my character in every pattern of plaid available and all but outed me on national TV before I even realized what the hell I was</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Banging her fist down on the bar) I KNEW you were one of us!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> No, lieutenant, I am NOT &quot;one of you&quot; - stop trying to pigeon hole me to raise your own self worth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> My self worth is just FINE, chica - I'm not the one hiding behind the space frog mask</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> At least &quot;Sigma 7&quot; allows me to stretch beyond the stereotype of Jamie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Mimicking Marcy's voice) Yes, exalted one - we will overtake Krakus Prime with the help of the moon wraiths</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Now mimicking Anita) Sir, may I see your boating license?</p>

<div class="stage">Anita can't help but laugh as Marcy stirs her drink.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> OK, you got me there - so tell me, what happened during the time between the end of &quot;Lessons&quot; and the start of &quot;Sig7?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> During the first few years, I played every girlfriend/wife/mother/hooker/rape victim role I could get my hands on just to bust the Jamie image</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Oh yeah, I remember one movie where your husband kept you locked in a trunk and drilled holes in your feet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Yes, a real reel highlight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Then what did you do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Drugs... lots of them - the white dragon express took me to Europe for awhile - I was able to indulge in every form of decadence over there in relative obscurity</p>

<div class="stage">Anita just drinks her beer and shakes her head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> When the money ran out and my mother had a massive heart attack, I returned stateside to be close to my family - took small roles in local theater, playing off what little name I had left - at the same time, a crappy but effects-laden show called &quot;Ancient Space&quot; starting turning in big syndication numbers - the powers that be decided to hire someone with actual talent as a head writer and they spun off &quot;Sigma 7&quot; - they asked me to join the cast and here I am</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Playing Bogree, the frog lady</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Hey, this character has more depth and complexity than all of my others combined - I LOVE playing her - besides, it's bringing in the money again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Not to mention a handsome Aussie bartender boyfriend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Fiance</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Winking) Gotcha</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Checking her watch) Well, I guess I should be heading back to the set - maybe I'll see you around again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Not looking at her) Maybe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Goodnight, Anita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Goodnight... Marcy</p>
