<div class="stage">Across the street from KCON, Takanachi and Isaacson relax on a hard plastic booth inside of a Krispy Kreme. Zach sneaks a bite of Gracie's doughnut while she's in the restroom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Returning) I just realized something... I'm now tinkling in the key of C minor, I wonder if I have a kidney infection?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach quickly swallows and gives a thumbs up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Aghast) DID YOU JUST TAKE A BITE OF MY DOUGHNUT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Innocent) Um... no - I &quot;taste-tested&quot; it</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c17_zach.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Flopping in the booth) Right!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Look, this was the last fresh doughnut they had with chocolate sprinkles</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> JIMMIES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> SPRINKLES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> JIMMIES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> SPRINKLES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> WHATEVER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Aw, c'mon, we usual go about two minutes with this!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'm tired today</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Is Half back in town?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Heh, if he is, he hasn't called me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Sorry</p>

<div class="stage">Fingers pushes the rest of the doughnut towards Eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Go ahead, it's yours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, I know how much writers make a year, you can't afford another whole one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Stuffing it in his mouth) True</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Besides, I just remembered something Jeremy said</p>

<div class="stage">There is a long pause.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> And?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Margarita men and double bacon cheeseburgers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Toying with him) You mean that DIDN'T make sense to you? - wow, Zach, you're losing your touch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> But... wait a minute... I... HUH? - there's too much weird shit going on around this town, you don't need to add to it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> My theory is that, one night, while we were sleeping, the ghost of Milton Bradley hovered over the entire Quartz County area, sneezed funky ectoplasm on us, and we all instantly became game pieces without our knowledge</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Oddly enough, that DOES make sense - it would explain M&amp;M's freakatude</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at her watch) Actually, I think this girl is an entirely different realm... she should be here soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Pensive expression) Hey Grace?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What's that tone?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I've been wondering...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Your father should have had that talk with you when you were 12</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'm being serious here - what if Morrigan shot that priest?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Oh please, not you too?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Why, who else has been questioning it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Only every third person at the station - people are so easily swayed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Why aren't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Zach, try to use your pea brain - what possible motive is there? - she's been here for less than a year</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c17_gracie.jpg" h="490" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> A lot could have happen during that time - a lot HAS happened</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Granted, trouble does seem to follow her around like a hungry stray but why would she go out and deliberately cause MORE for herself?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Maybe she feeds off of the drama?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> There are OTHER ways to create drama without offing a man of the cloth!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What if he put the moves on her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> So what if he did? - she could have easily ended that situation with some harsh words or a sharp knee to the groin - not shredding the preacher's aorta with a hollowpoint</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Drumming his fingers on the table) I suppose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Come on, if nothing else, she has covered countless crime scenes with her job and is the daughter of an LAPD detective</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Commander</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> High-ranking pig - you get the point - if she were to commit a crime, don't you think she'd be smarter in how she went about doing it?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach plays with his napkin and mulls over the statement.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hell, you and I could have come up with something better than what happened at St. B's - it was too clean, too easy - it is so obvious to anyone who dares look past the surface that she is being framed... of course, in today's world, no on ever does</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> That's what she WANTS us to think</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Dude, you have been watching X-Files for too long, give it up!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Someone wants to frame her WHY exactly?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> And you call yourself a journalist? - that is for us to figure out - I'd bet the house...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> You don't have a house</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'd bet the farm...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No farm, either</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'd bet the rolling turd...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No one would ever take the KCON van as a bet</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie glares at him in silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'd bet my remaining eight fingers...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'll take that bet!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That it has something to do with the story she's currently working on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking away) I don't know for sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Well, that clears that up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> She said that she would get us involved when the situation became more &quot;urgent&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Folding his arms) URGENT? - she is about to get her ass hauled off to prison, I'd say that qualifies as urgent!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> One way or the other, we'll be involved</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Am I supposed to read something into that statement?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Morri knew she was going to get yanked at KCON, so she called me up to do a wipe of her hard drive before Turner and Kylee could get their paws on it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Mouth open) DID YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> JESUS, GRACIE, THAT'S TAMPERING WITH POSSIBLE EVIDENCE THEY COULD NAME YOU AS AN ACCOMPLICE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> SHHH, would you please keep your voice down?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No one heard, they're too blissed out on deep-fried fat and sugar</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> No one saw me do it - I was careful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Let's hope so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What concerns me is that someone else was going through her files before I got there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Probably Kylee or Turner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> No, Shepperton's perfume lingers for hours and Gates doesn't have the patience to crack an encryption code</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Who, then?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'm keeping my eyes and ears open - at least I was able to make a copy of her story notes and I made a duplicate for me... just in case</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Did you read them yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Sighing) Briefly skimmed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> AND? - what is the story about</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I can't tell you... not yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Throwing his napkin in disgust) OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Sorry, Zach, I made Morrigan a promise not to crash the party yet - besides, you will be involved soon enough, BELIEVE ME, but if too much comes out at once, things will get screwed up majorly for McBride... for all of us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Takanachi, I am stunned - you've known me for YEARS, you've known Morri for MONTHS - this is insane!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Soft voice) Look, I have to go with my gut on this and my gut says go with McB's plan - I can't explain to you why, you'll simply have to trust me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Sour expression) Gracie, I don't want to see you get dragged down into her ever-growing quicksand pit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> We both have been sinking into this mess the minute she stepped foot into town</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Why do I get the feeling it's not going to miraculously stabilize either?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Glancing out the window) I think I just saw her car, switch the subject!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Smug) Well, I have been sitting on a little secret of my own - a Sig Seven secret involving our favorite warrior moon queen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Clasping her hands with joy) SHE'S BEING DEPORTED</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Serbia is probably looking pretty damn good to her right about now - apparently, hubby Martel caught her with another man</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> OOOH, WHO?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Pulling at the corners of his eyes and donning an exaggerated accent) Ancient Chinese Secret</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Smacking him on the arm) For the last time, I am JAPANESE you racist Jew bastard, now spill it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Evil grin) Someone you know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Personally or professionally?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> A little of both - it's someone you can't stand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's everybody, narrow it down!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Who was sporting a nasty shiner last night at Muldoon's and blamed it on &quot;an errant volleyball smash?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Grabbing the table) NOOOO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> YEEEES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> NO WAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> YEAHUH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Making a disgusted faced) CAPTAIN CRUNCH?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> It wasn't Count Chocula</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> R'xal and Phelps... EEEEEEEEWWWW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I know the feeling - question is, do we put it up on our Sig7 website?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Is it substantiated?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Judging by Old Man Martel's sudden broken wrist from a &quot;polo accident,&quot; - I'd say OH YES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Write it in obscure enough language to free us from potential lawsuits and I'll post it up there by tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Excellent, I'll e-mail it to you later</p>

<div class="stage">Wearing a dark trench coat, dark glasses, and a silk scarf over her head, Morrigan enters the doughnut shop and heads over to Zach and Gracie.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c17_morri_incognito.jpg" h="564" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Do we hound you for your autograph or are you going to flash us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Shut it, Zach - how are you doing, Morri?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking a seat) I'm a virtual prisoner in my own home - I can't concentrate enough to read but I did make an amazing discovery... more like two... first, TV really sucks - second, I know I'm getting old when I'd rather watch PBS over MTV</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Is anyone bothering you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Only a dozen menacing messages on my machine so far, KJ's security team has kept neighbors from egging the house... oh, and Amy tells me it's a good day to play the lottery</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Giving her friend a hug) I'm sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Did she tell you which numbers?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Scowling at Zach and then returning to Morrigan) Did you reach your dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> He's in the South of France with Nancy and her sisters - I didn't want to bother them yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Maybe you can fax them when they're strapping you into the electric chair?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> DAMMIT, ISAACSON, SHOW SOME COMPASSION</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> WHY? - I'M BEING KEPT OUT OF THIS LITTLE CLIQUE, WHY SHOULD I CARE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> CHILDREN, CHILDREN, PLEASE - I assume by your statement, Zachary, that Gracie let something slip</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan kicks Takanachi under the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I want you to know that you will be brought in on this, I promise... but not now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Pounding his fist down) WHY?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Because I know your competitive nature - you will be salivating to get this story to print and I just cannot take that chance!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Sitting back in astonishment) YOU WANT TO OUT-SCOOP ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Bopping him on the thigh) NO, IGNORAMUS, SHE WANTS TO SAVE YOUR FREAKING LIFE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> This story goes beyond all of our journalism careers, not only are our lives at stake, all of the Santa Conchita Valley is at stake, the country... even the world</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Shaking his head) PLEASE - is this where the ominous music kicks in? - Gracie, you're the DJ, fire it up!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I really don't have time to debate this with you, Zach, it will all become exceedingly clear very soon - right now, I need you two to tell me everything you know about Joenne Mirabello</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Does this include bedroom habits?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Turning to Takanachi) Gracie, I need you to tell me everything you know about Joenne Mirabello</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Uh, I don't know all that much - she and her sister were born and raised here two steps above poverty - they love each other but never really got along too well - Justine was the brainy one while Joenne was always the wild one - she does temp work and studies dance... that's about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Don't forget the PCP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan and Gracie</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Crack and acid weren't enough for Joenne, she did some dust... until she was busted by the same cops she works for now - doncha love irony?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> As a child, Justi was thrilled with some books and a microscope but Joey was always sullen - the &quot;unaccompanied minor&quot; on the airplane looking for a real family - at first, she found that family on the streets, but now, thankfully, she has a real sober family with her dance class</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Staring Zach in the eye) Can she be trusted?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why, is she a source?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still staring at Zach) CAN SHE BE TRUSTED?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Shrugging his shoulders) I would trust Justine before her sister, I can't really say for sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> IS JOENNE A SOURCE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe... or a significant complication - I've gotta go</p>

<div class="stage">Before Gracie and Zach can say anything further, Morrigan dashes out the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Gritting her teeth) DAMN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I think I need another doughnut!</p>

<div class="stage">Inside the Quartz County Coroner's Office, Justine Mirabello waits for her boss to leave on a golf outing. Once she knows it is safe, she sneaks into the high security cold storage area and retrieves the body of Father Greg.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Wheeling it into the autopsy room) Forgive me, Father, 
 for I have sinned... I lied to my supervisor about the real reason 
 I was staying late - to check your hole-i-ness out - I have also taken 
 the Lord's name in vain on multiple occasions, mostly concerning my 
 sister, and have had daily carnal thoughts involving one Zachary Isaacson 
 and a jar of extra chunky peanut butter</p>


<div class="stage">Over the next twenty minutes, Justine pokes and prods, taking notes on her observations.</div>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c17_justine.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Into her mini recorder) The level of necrosis throughout the body is astonishing, especially for a seemingly healthy 41-year-old man</p>

<div class="stage">Justine takes some tissue and fluid samples, storing them in her backpack.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Why Father Greg, whomever did you get your liver from? - I have to do some more testing but I'm reasonably sure it's not going to match the rest of your body - in fact, I'm guessing it's several times older than your body, if it IS your body... now who needs to confess?</p>

<div class="stage">She struts over to a portable CD player and turns on Bruce Springsteen's &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; and continues her examination.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Stunned by her findings) This is not even irrational, it's more like &quot;a-rational&quot; - nothing makes the slightest bit of sense - this is beyond Tiki Bonfiglio bizarre</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can continue, she hears her boss' SUV pull into the parking lot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Panicked) HOLY SHIT, pardon me Father, he wasn't supposed to be back this soon!</p>

<div class="stage">Inside a small dance studio, Joenne Mirabello rehearses to Rage Against the Machine's version of &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&quot; As she finishes, she is startled to hear polite applause. She turns around to find Morrigan leaning against the entrance, watching.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Why are you here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's time to trade stories, Ms. Mirabello</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I didn't call for this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Approaching her) Well, I just did - shall we go somewhere?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Grabbing a towel) OK... since you want to play that way, we might as well go to the place in question</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Heading for her car) Let's dance!</p>
