      <p>Zach and Gracie bust Morrigan out of the hospital and show her the footage of the "blue flash" igniting the oil slick. While trying to decide on a costume for the museum ball, KJ butts heads with his father, questions his sister, and makes a date. After dealing with perplexing goo and the bathroom habits of the rich and famous, Morrigan finally settles into her new house with Amethyst and Roshumba.</p>

<div class="stage">At the east entrance of Bay Valley Medical Center, a nurse slowly rolls Morrigan out of the hospital in a wheelchair.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting up) Thank you, I think I can manage</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Nurse</span> Hospital policy</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I understand but I'll be fine</p>

<div class="stage">The nurse looks around the parking lot.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Nurse</span> Is anyone picking you up?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My father was supposed to be here but his wife sidetracked him into buying antiques</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Nurse</span> I'm sorry</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking at her watch) Hmm, my co-worker should be here any minute</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Nurse</span> Remember, you need rest and relaxation</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm looking forward to it</p>

<div class="stage">Tires screech around the corner as the big brown newsvan comes tearing into the parking lot.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I was looking forward to it</p>

<div class="stage">The van roars right up next to Morrigan and the nurse. Gracie and Zach jump out simultaneously.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Taking Morrigan away from the nurse) GET IN THE VAN, GET IN THE VAN, HELLO, GET IN THE VAN</p>

<div class="stage">Zach heaves her belongings in the back as all three get inside.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Nurse</span> REST AND RELAXATION, MS. MCBRIDE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Squealing tires) Whatever, lady - OK, Morri, you have GOT to see this</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> SLOW DOWN</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Where are we going Grace?</p>

<img class="add-modal"   b="0" h="208" w="300" src="assets/images/y1c9_newsvan.gif" alt="The KCON Newsvan" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> There's an In 'n Out Burger on the corner</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I could use some fries</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> NO, too many people - go to the Hobo Jungle!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> There are people there, Dumbass!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> But they're HOBOS</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Would you two, for the love of God, please calm down, slow down, and show me what it is you want me
    to see?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie pulls into an underground parking garage and shuts the motor while Zach opens up an ice chest.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> THAT'S what you wanted to show me, a cooler full of beer?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Removing a false bottom and retrieving a tape) Patience, patience</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Popping it into the player) Now I know why someone stole my footage</p>

<div class="stage">As the petite woman with straight dark hair scans through the tape, Morrigan reflects on what happened to her at the train
    wreck. She sees the hand again in her mind.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Ready?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Huh? - yes</p>

<div class="stage">The tape plays at normal speed. A close-up of the train cars on fire widens out to a view of the river.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> There it is!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Watching) What?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Didn't you see it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> See what? - the train exploding?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Backing the tape up) What CAUSES the train to explode... watch</p>

<div class="stage">The segment is played again, this time in slow motion.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Noticing something) A blue flash... is that lightning?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Lightning comes from the sky, THIS came from the river!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe it was some kind of weird weather thing, you know, with the oil, water, and fire - I didn't pay
    attention in my science classes, I was too busy doing the football players' English homework</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Yeah, me too</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan and Gracie look at Zach.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> NOT PAYING ATTENTION IN SCIENCE CLASS</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone returns to the monitor.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I thought about a weather phenomenon at first, but then I enhanced the image...</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie pushes a few buttons and the section of the flash is magnified.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That looks like a rod of some kind</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> It's certainly not a flare gun</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> It lit the train like a fucking Christmas tree!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Don't you mean a Hanukkah Menorah?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do you think the Coast Guard set it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's far from standard issue equipment</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Knowing Anita, if she got some kind of magic wand that shot lightning bolts, she be walking around with
    it strapped to her hoo...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan &amp; Gracie</span> ZAAACH</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> HELICOPTER, I was going to say HELICOPTER</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Serious) Morrigan, you kept telling me about a hand last night - the green hand in your dream... is there
    a connection?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Lying) I'm not sure</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Who or whatever helped you to shore could have very well caused this explosion</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why would anyone want to do that?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Because the officials didn't have the balls to do it - I talked to Dr. Sanchez this morning, that fire was
    a blessing happening when it did</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her head) Magic wands, green hands, mysterious fires - this all sounds like a lame comic book
    by some sci-fi geek with no life!</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Zach appear ready to kill Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Sci-Fi and comic books ARE cool!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> And we DO have lives!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sorry... but you do agree about the &quot;geek&quot; part, right?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Affirmative</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Absofragginglutely</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Look, I know this is a major deal here but I'm tired, I have to get my things from the von Meers and
    I need to go home... please!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> I suppose we can do that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Starting the van) One of my contacts can help me enhance this shot even more, we'll go over it all later</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> After you settle in, try to remember what happened to you last night</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan stares out the window at the river as they drive by.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll try</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside the von Meer estate, KJ is trying on different costumes for the Museum Ball later in the week. He heads downstairs
    to get his parents' opinion.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Wearing a mask covered in leaves) Where's mom?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Not looking up from his paper) Where she always is, either on the court or in the shops</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> So, what do you think of my costume?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Briefly looking up) The Jolly Green Giant?</p>

<img class="add-modal"   b="0" h="150" w="180" src="assets/images/y1c9_greenman.gif" alt="The Green Man" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Pulling the mask up) NO, I'm the Green Man!</p>

<div class="stage">Karl Senior looks incredulously at him.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Ona Rosa suggested it</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Returning to his paper) Ahh</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Throwing his paper down) It means, when are you going to stop acting like a child and help me with
    the financial reports?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> SOON, I promise... I just have to make a few quick phone calls and we can get started</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Getting up to leave) You know where to find me</p>

<div class="stage">KJ shakes his head and makes his way to the kitchen. Erika, still in surgical scrubs, enters through the back door next to
    it. The two stare at each other's outfits.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Jolly Green Giant?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Hurling the mask on the table) I guess I'll go with &quot;Plan B: D'Artagnan&quot; - but you're going to
    have to come up with something more creative than a doctor</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Pouring some orange juice) What?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> That's your costume for the Museum Ball, right?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Oh no, that's this week, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> YEAH - you know how important this is to Lydia... you can't bail</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I know</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> So, if that's not your ball costume... why are you dressed like that?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika slowly sips her juice.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I would say &quot;kinky time with Griffy&quot; but I know better</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> An experiment that went awry also went all over my clothes, so I changed into this</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Looking out the window at Dr. Martel's car) Is Stephanie here?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Trying to walk away) She let me borrow her car</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Following) Why were you at the hospital?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> JESUS... am I on the fucking witness stand? - I went over there to get some new supplies to redo the experiment,
    Steph saw what a mess I was and kindly offered the scrubs and the use of her car - END OF STORY</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Sandy and Shelby have been calling every hour on the hour wondering where in the hell you were last night</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I WAS THERE... it was just total chaos, we kept missing each other</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> When are you going to join the 20th century and get a cell phone?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> NEVER, I hate those things - now, if you don't have anymore questions, Counselor, I'd like to go to the
    bathroom and pee... is that permissible?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I'm just concerned about you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Heading upstairs) Save your concern for that ridiculous costume</p>

<div class="stage">KJ spots Gracie's van pulling up outside the house and goes to greet them.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Jumping out of the van) Yo, Kage</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Hey Fingers</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> What's up, man... why are you dressed like a fruitcake?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> This is my BALL COSTUME, Zach</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Hence the question... why are you dressed like a fruitcake?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I figured I'd save the rabbi costume for you, Isaacson</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> So sorry to interrupt this lovely exchange of anti-semitism and homophobia but I really need to get
    my things!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (All smiles) Forgive me, I haven't had the pleasure</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Extending her hand) Morrigan McBride</p>

<div class="stage">Instead of shaking her hand, KJ kisses it as Gracie and Zach roll their eyes.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> KJ von Meer</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Returning the smile) It's nice to meet you, Mr. von Meer</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Please, call me &quot;KJ&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Please call me bored!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> We're here to get Morri's U-Haul off of your property</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> That's too bad, it was just starting to really annoy my mother</p>

<div class="stage">All three laugh except Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You're really ugly, KJ</p>

<div class="stage">All three stare at her in shock.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Smirking at the incredibly handsome man) I just wanted to say something that you've never heard before</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone laughs and walks towards the large garage, separate from the mansion.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Congratulations on your heroism, Morrigan, that was the best thing I've seen on television in a long time</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> I helped</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you, I appreciate your family letting me keep my stuff here</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> No problem</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie gets paged.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at it) COOL, my contact is going to help us out with that footage enhancement tomorrow!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> What footage enhancement?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach and Morrigan glower at Gracie to shut up.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Without missing a beat) Porn videos, I got some new ones from The Netherlands and they need to be reworked</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Honestly, Fingers, the real thing is better</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I am aware of that but there's money to be made here - you know what a skinflint Turner is... a girl has
    got to eat</p>

<div class="stage">All three look at her wide hips.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> HEY</p>

<div class="stage">As they enter the garage, KJ flips on the lights, revealing over two dozen classic and late model cars with the U-Haul next
    a Lamborghini.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> OOOOOOHHHHH</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Um, I think I'll go pull the van around</p>

<div class="stage">Unimpressed, Morrigan heads straight for her trailer.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> IS THAT THE NEW DIABLO?</p>

<img class="add-modal"   b="0" h="95" w="250" src="assets/images/y1c9_diablo.gif" alt="El Diablo!" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Yeah, do you want to go for a ride?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> YEEEEEESSSSSSS</p>

<div class="stage">As KJ jogs off to get the keys, Zach hops in the car. Morrigan runs through the night of her car breaking down in her mind
    as she slowly circles the U-Haul.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking at the bumper) That's odd</p>

<div class="stage">There's a film of dust on it except for a tiny spot at the end.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Bending down) This has been wiped</p>

<div class="stage">Upon closer inspection, Morrigan notices some dried blood underneath the corner of the bumper and what appears to be a few
    scales.
</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Jumping up) Oh my God!</p>

<div class="stage">As she runs towards the main house, she passes KJ on the way.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> May I use your bathroom?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Go right ahead, you have seven to pick from... the Jungle Safari one is my favorite!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Once inside the mansion, Morrigan stops in her tracks for a moment to take in the grandeur of it all. As she walks among
    the opulent rooms, she rounds the corner and, once again, bumps into Erika as she comes out of the bathroom.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Stunned) Ms. McBride?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> We've got to stop meeting like this</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. von Meer does not smile.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Um, your brother said it was OK to use the bathroom</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Deadpan) Which one?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh, I'm not sure</p>

<div class="stage">The scientist gives the reporter a half-smile, steps aside, and gestures for her to use the one she just came from.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan abruptly closes the door behind her.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Under her breath) FREAK JOB... with all of her money, she needs to buy a personality</p>

<div class="stage">Going over to the sink, Morrigan turns on the water and starts to search through the cabinets.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Picking up a bottle of Karl Senior's Viagra) Ewww - too much information - now, where are the damn
    Q-Tips?
</p>

<div class="stage">As she continues to go through the toiletries, she finds an unmarked bottle of pills hidden in a towel.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's none of your business, it's none of your business - oh, what the hell</p>

<div class="stage">She opens the bottle and examines the medication inside.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> This looks just like Caitlin's Epilepsy medication... interesting... but not my concern</p>

<div class="stage">Hiding the bottle back in the towel, she closes the cabinet and continues her hunt.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OF COURSE, the Q-Tips are in the Swarovski crystal swan jar, right in front of my face - great investigative
    skills, McBride</p>

<div class="stage">Quickly grabbing two of the them, she shuts the water and exits the room. On her way back to the garage, she stops in the
    kitchen and looks through the drawers.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> This is sad, my whole house could fit into this one room</p>

<div class="stage">She comes across some Ziploc plastic bags.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing two of them) YES</p>

<div class="stage">As she turns around to leave, Erika is standing there watching.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> My brother also said you could pack a lunch?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, no... I just... um, one of my... uh, I just need these, alright? - I'll PAY you for them</p>

<div class="stage">With her arms folded, Erika slowly approaches Morrigan, looking directly into her eyes.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Don't worry about that, tell me what you need them for?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Backing away) A really unique water balloon fight - I should be going - good day, Dr. von Meer</p>

<div class="stage">She slips out the door and joins the others outside. Zach and KJ are speeding off in the Lamborghini as Gracie and Karl Senior
    fix the tire on the U-Haul and hitch the trailer to the back of the van.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking up) Hey Morri, this is KJ's dad, he's giving us a hand</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I am forever in your debt, Mr. von Meer</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> It's my pleasure, ladies, how did this happen?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's what I'd like to know</p>

<div class="stage">As Gracie and Karl Senior continue with their chit chat, Morrigan casually goes to the bumper, swabs the blood stain and
    scales with both Q-Tips, places them each in a baggie, and folds them away in her purse.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> That should do it, are you ready to roll?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What about Zach?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking down the road) We'll get him on the way</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Tossing his tools in the box) I guess I'll get Erika to help me with those financial reports... nice
    to have met you, Ms. McBride</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Climbing into the van) Thanks again for all of your help, Mr. von Meer</p>

<div class="stage">Looking down from her bedroom window, Erika watches them drive off. As the two women head onto the highway, KJ and Zach pull
    up along side of them and honk.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Zach, get in here, we're leaving!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Behind the wheel) Hmm, go see my crazy ex-girlfriend or drive an Italian sports car - DECISIONS, DECISIONS</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> ZACH</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Pulling over) OK, OK</p>

<div class="stage">As Isaacson gets into the van, KJ saunters over to Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (All smiles) Ms. McBride, would you like to accompany me to the Museum Ball this Friday night?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is stunned silent as both Gracie and Zach nudge her in the ribs.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I'd like to get to know you better</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh really?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> That was a totally innocent statement</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) Oh, really?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Think of it as a prime opportunity to meet the fine citizens of Duquesa Bay</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey, don't forget the fine citizens of Santa Conchita!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Whatever - also, think of it as a prime opportunity to dress up like a fool</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan laughs and tosses her hair back as she considers his offer.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Sticking her head out the window) SHE'D LOVE TO, KAGE, WE'LL SEE YOU LATER</p>

<div class="stage">The van takes off down the road.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That was rude</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> You're learning</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Just a little reminder, we all have work tomorrow, I'd like to get your belongings taken care of so that
    I might enjoy the rest of my Sunday, thank you very much</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm starving</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> You're in luck, Amy makes the best BBQ tofu burger I've ever tasted</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yummy</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> It tastes even better without the cat hair</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">A little later, they pull up in front of Amethyst Hill's house and find the bubbly blonde with a few purple braids hanging
    upside down from a magnolia tree.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> ROSHUMBA, ROSHUMBA</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Getting out) Yep, we're here</p>

<img class="add-modal"   b="0" h="229" w="400" src="assets/images/y1c9_amys_house.jpg" alt="Amethyst's House" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Zachy is that you? - Roshumba is stuck in the tree again, come help me get her!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Climbing up) Aw man</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Amy, this is your new renter, Morrigan McBride</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Jumping down) Hello, it's so nice to finally meet you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I deeply apologize for not being here sooner</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> No worries... what's your rising sign?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Um, I'm not sure</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> That's OK, we'll figure it out when I do your reading</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My reading?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I love your name, by the way, it's so unique!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's my mom's doing, dad wanted to name me &quot;Mary&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Smart mom - my birthname is boring, that's why I had it legally changed the minute I turned 18</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What was your original name?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> That subject is OFF limits</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sorry, I'm just naturally curious</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> TYSON, STOP LICKING AMBER'S BUTT, THAT IS SO NOT COOL - CAN'T YOU SEE WE HAVE COMPANY?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan looks baffled as Gracie points out the cats on the porch.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> She names them after supermodels</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who doesn't?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> OOOOOWWWWW</p>

<div class="stage">A calico cat climbs out of the tree into Amy's arms.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Jumping down) Your dumb cat scratched my nose!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Seeing your face was enough to repel her out of the tree, thank you Honey</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> You know how to thank me</p>

<div class="stage">The two start to flirt with each other.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> This is all really fun but let's get Morri's stuff MOVED</p>

<div class="stage">Over the next hour, they all bring boxes into the guest cottage. Morrigan pauses for a moment and looks around the English
    Country style rooms.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> This is really NICE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Let me guess, Zach and Gracie told you horror stories about the decor in my house</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, no... well, they did mention a few things</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Picking up a purring Roshumba) Gracie should talk, have you seen her place?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Unfortunately so - but she also told me that you make the best BBQ tofu burger in the world</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I'll prove it - after you get settled in, come on over and we can do the rent stuff when we eat</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sounds good</p>

<div class="stage">As Amethyst goes to leave, she pats Morrigan on the shoulder. The contact causes both of them to freeze for a second as Roshumba
    hisses.
</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Suddenly turning very somber) You have been touched</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Huh?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Leaving) We will do your reading soon!</p>

<div class="stage">Awhile later, with most of the stuff unpacked, Morrigan takes a break and stretches out on the couch. Gracie brings some
    lemonade and joins her.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Where's Zach?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Off getting &quot;thanked&quot; by Amy</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I thought they broke up?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> It's one of those, &quot;I love you, I hate you, let's still have sex no matter what&quot; relationships</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I see</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Is your dad due soon?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I just called him a little bit ago and told him not to come - I'm fine and his wife is more than happy
    with her walnut armoire</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Are you sure you're OK, you've been through quite the weekend?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll be alright after I get a good night's sleep</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at her watch) Well, Zach should be done in a minute... literally... unless there's anything else
    you need, I'm going to get going</p>

<div class="stage">The two exchange hugs.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks, Gracie, for all of your help - it means a lot</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> We have the afternoon shift tomorrow, I'll be by to pick you up at 1:00, the mechanic should have your
    car ready by then</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Seeing her out the door) Great... have a good evening!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> And YOU have a QUIET one</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Under her breath) Here's hoping</p>

        <br>

        <p>At this time last weekend, I was covering my final story at my old job -- the grand opening of a Starbucks -- this
            weekend, I return home to California and, literally, all hell broke loose!</p>


        <p>For some mysterious reason, my car crashes. Three men are murdered not far from where I was. There's a train wreck
            with oil spilling into the river. I go to save a man, it turns out to be a dog, the train explodes and I nearly
            drown except some weird creature saved me. This creature might have been the one to cause the explosion with
            its magic wand from fairy tale land. In the hospital, the station manager himself comes to my room to congratulate
            me, while my new, apparently promiscuous co-worker makes it abundantly clear that I better not piss on any of
            her trees. I find some funky blood on my U-Haul, then I get asked to a masquerade ball by one of the richest
            men in the state. Finally, I move into my new house with Roshumba and I officially start work tomorrow.</p>


        <p>As for the people, Gracie and Zach are total sweethearts, I couldn't have made it through this weekend without them.
            Amy is a little spacey but nice. Turner seems like your typical asshole boss, I'm going to have to watch my back
            with Kylee. Captain Phelps and Lieutenant Fiore... no comment. I admire Dr. Martel, she's professional and caring.
            KJ von Meer is a total stud but I can't help but wonder if he sees me as his next &quot;notch&quot; (sorry, buddy).
            His dad seems cool, I hope those pills work for him. As for Erika von Meer... she creeps me out and I don't know
            why.
