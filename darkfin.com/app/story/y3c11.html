<div class="stage">Early morning breaks over the Santa Conchita Valley. Craig and Anita 
 land their helicopter at an emergency base camp set up on the north 
 end of Chaparral Heights. Emergency crews from all over the state meet 
 with FEMA as a smoking Mount Wiggins looms in the distance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> My legs feel like noodles right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Rice or egg?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Both</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I could go for a stiff drink...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You're joking, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Maybe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> How about settling for a bottle of aspirin instead?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Can I wash them down with gin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Checking her watch) C'mon, cap - now is not the time to fall 
 off the wagon - I think we both need a good nap, especially if they 
 want us to pull another shift</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You can catch a few winks during the endless meetings we have 
 ahead of us - just make sure command doesn't see you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Two hours to tell us ten different ways to do one thing we can 
 do ourselves in five minutes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Feds are crawling on our turf now, play nice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Do I have to?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> At least for the next five minutes...</p>

<div class="stage">An official from the Department of Homeland Security approaches them. 
 He's wearing sunglasses and an all-too-clean suit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> (Extending his hand) Captain Phelps, I need you to coordinate 
 with my team on the evacuation process of the east valley</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Sure thing - so far, all is going well - we've checked the major 
 roads in and out, traffic is moving along fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Thank God it's no longer blowing chunks the way it did last night 
 - in fact, it's almost unnatural how it just stopped all of the sudden... 
 don't you think, G-man?</p>

<div class="stage">The official looks over his shades and eyeballs Anita.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> We have a geology team from SCU giving us possible outcomes 
 - we need to plan on the worst case scenario until otherwise - is that 
 clear?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Can you tell us what special ops was doing? - one of their jets 
 nearly caught us in a down draft</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> (Tensing up) You must be mistaken, lieutenant, special ops 
 was no where near the event</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah, they were</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Anita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Look, I know how everything is all hush hush with you guys but 
 we nearly got taken out without warning</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> (Now looking at Craig) Special ops was NOT involved</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> DON'T KEEP DICKING AROUND WITH US, SE&Ntilde;OR - this 
 qualifies as a national emergency and we have every right to be kept 
 informed!</p>
 
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c11_anita.jpg" h="347" w="610"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> Captain, please remind your lieutenant that I have the authority 
 to reprimand her if she keeps challenging me - and, if I am not mistaken, 
 both of you have enough disciplinary actions to deal with already</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Fiore, go check the latest weather reports</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> BUT...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Looking her in the eye) DON'T MAKE ME ASK YOU AGAIN</p>

<div class="stage">Anita goes to say something but bites her tongue and storms off in 
 a huff.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> Will she be an issue?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> No, sir... but we both know what we saw</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> We all saw plenty of interesting things last night, captain 
 - things that do not merit public discussion</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Understood</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Official</span> Good - now, get inside - my team is waiting for your assessment</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">In the crowded parking lot of a cheap roadside motel, Gracie sets 
 up the KCON newsvan for a live remote shoot with Kylee. A single strand 
 of black smoke can still be seen swirling above Mount Wiggins.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Checking the equipment) YES... we got a satellite uplink to 
 the station - we're on in ten!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> When are we going to get our cells back?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Not for awhile - Wiggins was THE site for large antennas - I 
 can patch you through on the uplink if you really need to call someone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Fixing her hair) Nah, that's okay... no matter how hard I try, 
 I can't get this soot shit off of me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Just think of it as a lively 'Bama barbecue bash</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I'm not in the mood for your digs right now, Gracie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> No, I'm sorry - I didn't get enough beauty rest last night</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie is silent as she watches Zach at the other end of the lot, 
 just standing and staring at the mountain range.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Wow, you really are sorry - I gave you the perfect set-up and 
 you didn't even attempt a joke!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at the latest wire reports) Amazingly enough, I don't 
 even find my jokes appropriate right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> The Quartz Lake Inn?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Cinders - the lava flow emptied into the lower end of the lake 
 but stopped there - the railroad and part of the airfield out there 
 were hit as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Have they come up with a death toll yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> 18 confirmed with over two dozen still missing - mostly hikers, 
 campers and rural inhabitants</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> That aint half bad!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Come again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I mean considering it looked like that thing was about to take 
 out this entire valley</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Connecting the microphone) True enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> It was weird how it just shut off quicker than it started up 
 - what do you suppose happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Who the hell knows? - California has enough natural disasters 
 without adding &quot;volcanoes&quot; to the list... if it was a natural 
 disaster</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I don't know - I thought for sure I was going to be garlic-roasted 
 Gracie last night, then I had to sleep in a dive not worthy of a derelict 
 with you, Zach, and Mirabello all taking turns farting...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> That was NOT me - I always excuse myself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> And now I just got word that our feed is going live nationwide 
 - you expect me to be coherent?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> OOH, NATIONWIDE? - HOW'S MY LIPSTICK?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie looks at a huge smudge of mascara under Kylee's eye and thinks 
 for a second.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Giving her the thumb up) Your lipstick is fine - we're good 
 to go!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Turning serious) Gracie... was I dreaming or did you hear Zach 
 crying in the bathroom last night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Hearing the same thing) Um, you were probably dreaming - or 
 it was the people next door... two minutes counting down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Lemme do a quick run-through with my intro and let me know if 
 I convey enough emotion in my tone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Tone? - are you auditioning for a part in Sigma Seven? - this 
 is a news story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> A SAD news story but I can't appear too depressed or too chipper 
 - remember, this is going across the country</p>
<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c11_kylie.jpg" h="450" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> NO TIME NOW, WE'RE ON IN TEN... NINE... EIGHT...</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Zach is now inside the motel room. He slumps on the bed and watches 
 Kylee on the television.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> ...with residents still leaving the area, the possibility of 
 more eruptions is a fear everyone can see and feel here in the Santa 
 Conchita Valley - for KCON NewsCenter8, this is Kylee Shepperton reporting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Muttering) Lousy tag, Kylee - Morri would have done a better 
 job...</p>

<div class="stage">He fights back tears and vigorously rubs his face with 
 his hands. Gracie enters the room carrying two cups of coffee and a 
 bag.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Glancing at the TV) They're still running our piece?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> It's been on five channels so far</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Damn, I was hoping for an even half-dozen</p>

<div class="stage">Zach does not respond.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> The coffee shop was a madhouse but I managed to snare you some 
 waffles</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Syrup?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Nope, sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> How do you eat waffles without syrup?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie takes a waffle out of the bag and happily demonstrates.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Mouth full) Kylee is still there flirting with the cook - maybe 
 I could get her to score you some jam?</p>

<div class="stage">Again, Zach barely responds.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You know, the laptop is working just fine if you wanted to write 
 up a quickie for the paper</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Staring at the wall) No thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> The roads out of town are still pretty packed but we could head 
 down south</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What's the sense?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Nevermind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I was talking with Justine over breakfast - she was telling 
 me more about the creepoid Father Greg and...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I don't want to hear about it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> But...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I SAID, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT, GRACE</p>

<p a="center"><img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y3c11_zach.jpg" h="478" w="610"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> WELL, MAYBE I DO - JESUS, EYES, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach darts up from the bed and heads for the door. Gracie blocks his 
 exit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Forget all the volcano stuff for a minute - I want to know exactly 
 what happened to you last night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Not looking at her) No... you don't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You briefly mentioned something about Amethyst and Morrigan?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> MORRI IS DEAD - OKAY? - WHEN MOUNT WIGGINS BLEW, SHE WENT RIGHT 
 ALONG WITH IT...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> How do you know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I WAS THERE - I HEARD HER CALL OUT TO ME - THOSE FUCKERS...</p>

<div class="stage">Unable to hold back, Zach bangs his fist against the wall and is now 
 in tears.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> They were going to torture her, too</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> WHO?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> AMY'S PSYCHO HOOD BRIGADE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You're not making any...</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can finish her sentence, Zach pushes her violently away 
 from the door. Gracie goes crashing back into the nightstand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Knocking over a lamp) WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach ignores her and goes to leave. As he throws open the door, Kylee 
 nearly runs into him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> JUSTINE HAS STOLEN THE NEWSVAN</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Griffin, KJ, Shelby, and Calvin all stand along the riverbank as a 
 search crew of divers and one lone sheriff's deputy complete their sweep 
 of the water.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deputy</span> We've been up and down this stretch six times, Mr. Martel - 
 there's no sign of her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Keep searching!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Maybe we need to expand further up stream?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Diver</span> That's not necessary - the flow of the river would keep the body 
 in this area or take it out to sea</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Grabbing the diver) BODY? - I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT WORD 
 AGAIN</p>

<div class="stage">The deputy comes between them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deputy</span> THAT is a distinct probability you are going to have to face 
 if Ms. Von Meer really did do this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Now directing his anger at the deputy) What are you are implying?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deputy</span> I'm trying to understand why she would take a header off your 
 balcony, Mr. Martel... willingly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> DO YOU THINK I'D BE OUT HERE HALF-CRAZY LOOKING FOR HER? - 
 CALLING HER BROTHER OVER TO HELP, IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deputy</span> I have no idea</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I want your supervisor heading up this search - call him in, 
 NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deputy</span> (Pointing) In case you haven't noticed the smoking mountain 
 off to you left, we're in a state of emergency right now and our resources 
 are limited</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> FINE, I'll bring in my own team since you are completely and 
 utterly USELESS</p>

<div class="stage">KJ pulls Griffin aside and they walk away from the deputy and the 
 divers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> We need to think about this - maybe... maybe we should check the 
 bay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> ERIKA IS NOT DEAD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Sniffling) I can't... I can't deal with losing my father AND my 
 sister - but why did she do this? - WHERE IS SHE, GRIFFIN?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I AM TRYING TO FIND OUT</p>

<div class="stage">The persistent ringing of Griffin's phone stops the two.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I thought cells were dead?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> This is my satellite phone - I need to take this</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin steps aside for a moment as Shelby comes over to KJ.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I need to take Calvin home - this has been a very taxing night 
 for all of us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I know... thanks, Shel</p>

<div class="stage">Before she leaves, she pulls a flower out her pocket and hands it 
 to KJ.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Erika is alive... I can feel it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Because your voodoo magic says so?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> It has nothing to do with my religious practices - I went to 
 Acapulco with your sister once - I watched as she shamed the local cliff 
 divers, one by one</p>

<div class="stage">KJ perks his head up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> If she did dive into the river of her own accord, then she still 
 walks among us - if not, I would have felt her passing - I did not feel 
 that last night, KJ, I promise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Calvin</span> We felt Chango, didn't we, mommy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Come along, Cal, time to go</p>

<div class="stage">With a puzzled look, KJ watches them leave as Griffin rushes over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> We need to leave!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> What about...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> NOW, KJ</p>

<div class="stage">Just outside of San Luis Obispo, Hector, Stephanie and Karl exit a

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (To the driver) Muchas gracias!</p>

<div class="stage">Stephanie helps a robed Karl stagger up the steps to the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Hector, go inside and ask for Dr. Kaplan, we interned 
 together</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Are you sure it's safe here, Stephi?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Safer than where we were - this place is known for keeping 
 quiet - a lot of celebrity facelifts</p>

<div class="stage">Hector hurries inside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Hold on, Karl - we're almost there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl</span> (Weak) I don't trust him - be careful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I want you to rest but when you're up to it, you need 
 to explain to me what is going on</p>

<div class="stage">An orderly with a wheelchair now approaches with Hector.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> All set - Dr. Kaplan is waiting inside</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Why? - the eruption has stopped, I'm sure your family 
 is okay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm going back to make sure OUR family is okay</p>

<div class="stage">A private jet is on final approach to Sacramento. George sits between 
 his wife and daughter as Kylee is shown on the television screen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Flipping the remote) Done</p>

<div class="stage">George comforts Lydia as Penny robotically keeps dialing her cell 
 phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I think the people still stuck in Duquesa Bay have more reason

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Penelope, don't antagonize your mother right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> That was aimed more at you than her, dad - wouldn't everyone 
 like to have a private jet at their disposal when fleeing imminent danger?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Your father is part of the state government, he needs to be here 
 in order to help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Fine, but why do we need to come along?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Wrapping his arm around her) Maybe because I want my wife and 
 little girl close to me instead of in the path of an unpredictable volcano?</p>

<div class="stage">Unable to resist her father's affection, Penny relents and snuggles 
 against his arm while deliberately knocking over her mother's crutch

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I just think everyone should have the same opportunities that 
 we do... that's all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I know you do, sweetie, you have a good heart buried underneath 
 those layers of black rags</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> She's just worried about that Jeremy heathen, that's all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Thank you for ruining a nice moment by opening your mouth, mom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I'm just stating the obvious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Glancing at George) I'm sure I'm not the only one worried about

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Grabbing her stomach) I... I don't feel so good all of the sudden</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Please don't vomit on your father's suit, he has a press conference</p>
