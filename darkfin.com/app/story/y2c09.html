        <div class="chapter">
          

<div class="stage">Sitting at a large metal desk inside his SCU office, Dr. Javier Sanchez studies some paperwork. He suddenly scowls and then flings a spreadsheet across the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Sighing) How does the university expect me to run this department if they give me shit for a budget?</p>

<div class="stage">A young, redheaded student pops her head in the door and grins at him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Now smiling) Did you finish your paper yet, Heather?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Heather</span> (Making sure her extra tight top is now in sight) Um, not quite - I'm still a little unfocused in my conclusions - I was hoping you could help me tighten them up a bit?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Scratching at his beard) I'd love to, Querida - I'll tell you what, I need to finish a few things here so why don't we meet up at Quartz Lake in a couple of hours - you can assist me in conducting some fresh water experiments and I'll take a closer look at your... paper</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Heather</span> (Giggling and twisting her hair) I am so there, Sandy, BYEEEE</p>

<div class="stage">Watching one of his favorite students slowly close the door behind her, Dr. Sanchez smirks to himself and resumes his work. He picks up the office phone and dials.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Leaving a voice mail) Hola, Shelby - I am going to need your help on this budget tomorrow so clear a few hours in the morning after your labs and tell Hajanian I really need him to cover tonight's lecture for me... unless I can convince Erika to do so - later!</p>

<div class="stage">As he hangs up, a call comes through for him on his cell phone.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c09_sandy.jpg" h="470" w="320"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Hello? - oh, hi Oni... actually, I was just about to call you - I'm going to be running a little late tonight so don't hold dinner for me - um... sure, I could do that - hold on, let me get a pen - OK, go ahead... cottage cheese, wild rice, and toilet paper - got it, I'll see you later, Querida</p>

<div class="stage">He hangs up and then dials it again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Anita, it's your favorite brother in-law - listen, I still don't have any conclusive evidence for you on those acoustic waves but I have now ruled out the porpoise - although is possesses the characteristic shape, the amplitude is more along the line of a very large orca - oh, and do me a huge favor, please bring your sister some cottage cheese, wild rice, and toilet paper - I'm going to be working late to get you some more answers on this mystery... gracias!</p>

<div class="stage">Just as he hangs up his cell phone, his office phone rings.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> AY... hello?</p>

<div class="stage">The man suddenly stiffens up and begins to sweat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Yes, sir - I will have those tests completed for you by week's end - oh, fine, tomorrow night if you insist - are we meeting at the regular location? - I'll be there for sure... can I expect my regular payment then? - no, NO - sir, I really don't think we need to involve her - but, but... whatever you think is necessary, goodbye</p>

<div class="stage">After picking at his cuticles for a moment, Dr. Sanchez leaves his office. Now in the main atrium, he saunters over to the department secretary.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking at his watch) Is Dr. von Meer still in class?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Secretary</span> She should be out in about 20 minutes, professor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Taking off) Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Making sure no one is around, he quietly slips into Erika's office and closes the door. Once inside, he begins to search through some papers while flipping on her computer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Writing some notes) My, my... what have you been up to, Rikka?</p>

<div class="stage">He takes a ZIP disk out of his jacket and begins to copy over several files.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Waiting for the computer to finish) I know you're used to living in the lap of luxury but that shouldn't prevent you from wanting to succeed... and succeed we will!</p>

<div class="stage">He takes out the disk and looks between the slats of the window shade. Waiting for a trio of students to leave the hall, he darts out of the room and heads back to his own office. On her way up the concrete stairs, Erika returns from class and calls to him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Where's the fire, Sandy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Spinning around on his heel) I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Fixing her glasses) Here I am</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> I was hoping you could...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Walking away) No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> But</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> NO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You don't even know what I was going to ask!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sighing and facing him) No, I cannot sub for you tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Please?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Have Tim do it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> He's already done it twice</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c09_erika.jpg" h="459" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What is so important that you have to duck out?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Clearing his throat) Department business</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> HA - does this &quot;department business&quot; happen to involve a certain grad student with really perky... ears?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking down at his shoes) And what, pray tell, do you have to do that's so important tonight, Miss Recluse?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Half smile) Family business</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Ah - hey, listen, I just finished reading the student evals this morning...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rolling her eyes) Here it comes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You received outstanding marks in most fields...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> But?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> The area of &quot;relating to and caring about your students&quot; was mediocre... well, actually, more on the poor side</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Are you suggesting I start listening to NSYNC songs and fuck them in the student union bathroom? - oh, wait, that's YOUR method</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Turning red) That only happened ONCE, it was during Ona Rosa's hypertensive pregnancy, and the girl seduced ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Look, I understand you resent having to teach &quot;beneath&quot; your level of knowledge but that's part of the job</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Maybe I should adopt Shelby's method of bringing in homemade cookies and sharing wacky island tales!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> It works! - c'mon, surely you must have a wacky tale or two to tell?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Biting her lip) Not really</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> THEN, MAKE UP ONE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Can I borrow a few from you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You don't NEED to - your class is 4:1 male, YOU'RE DROP-DEAD MODEL GORGEOUS... USE IT</p>

<div class="stage">Erika shakes her head and looks away from him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> It's only to your advantage, in and out of the classroom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You sound like my mother</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> And you should listen to her - oh, by the way, Anita is still pestering me for info on that acoustic wave anomaly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Subtle grin) Don't worry, I'll have something for the good lieutenant to look at soon enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> I appreciate that - you know, Rikka...</p>

<div class="stage">The tone in his voice piques the woman's interest.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> I really do appreciate your help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> For the last time, I am NOT doing your lecture tonight!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> I mean with other projects</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Sure, no problem</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> And if you ever needed MY help with something, I would like to believe that you could come to me and ask for it</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. von Meer wrinkles up her nose and chuckles half-jokingly.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What could ever I possibly need your help with, Sandy?</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. Sanchez looks on as Erika disappears behind her office door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Under his breath) You would be surprised</p>

<div class="stage">After sorting through some mail and phone messages, Erika sits down at her desk and flips on the computer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Touching it) Hmm, it's warm - someone has been using it - more justification for keeping a separate lab</p>

<div class="stage">She checks to see which files were previously opened.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sitting back) Heh, Sandy you have yet to learn how to cover your trail... I hope your wife doesn't see all the porn sites on your home computer</p>

<div class="stage">After deleting the files completely, she now sips at some hot tea and gazes up at a small photo of herself and her former colleagues in Sri Lanka.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You think you know something, Dr. Sanchez... it's not even the tip of the iceberg</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. von Meer quietly flashes back to her time on the island with her advisor, Dr. Samadara Ranasinghe of the Indian Ocean Marine Institute.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Finishing up in the lab) That's that... TIME FOR THE BEACH, YAY</p>

<div class="stage">Turning around, she notices her mentor observing her intently.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c09_sammi.jpg" h="506" w="220"  b="0" a="center"/>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Embarrassed) Is there something wrong, Dr. Ranasinghe?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Carrying a large sack) Erika, I have been your advisor for over a month, when are you going to start calling me Sam?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Stiffening) I apologize, I adhere to a strict principle of always addressing my superiors by their titles</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Cocking her head) This is not the army</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's a sign of respect and what I believe in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Actually, I was hoping to speak with you alone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Pulling up a lab stool next to Erika) Go ahead?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't want to sound like I am bragging but I'm almost out of work - I'll be completing my main courses of study here in a matter of days</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Yes, I am well aware of this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I still have more than three months to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> I am aware of this as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Then, what do you suggest I do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Tapping her sack) I'm sure we'll figure out something for you to do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Flustered) I don't appreciate the ill-defined response</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> It will all become very clear to you soon enough - I have the rest of your time here well-planned out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Again, not to sound rude, but I really have NO INTEREST in your fields of marine geology and metallurgy - transgenic ichthyology is what I'm here for... PERIOD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Yes... and no</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Gritting her teeth) Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> What if I offered a link between all three?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Honestly, Dr. Ranasinghe, the link could be made of diamond-studded dancing Devis and I wouldn't care</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Taking out an old book from her sack) Not quite but within the range</p>

<div class="stage">Erika is agape over the ancient text. She looks to her advisor for permission and then begins to delicately leaf through the pages.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Reverently) How old is this book?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Older than your country and mine... many times over</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What does it say?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> I will teach you - do you know the definition of Nereid?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Thinking) Sea nymphs according to Greek Mythology... as well as a moon of Neptune</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Very good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't understand?</p>

<div class="stage">Samadara carefully pulls back the shell bracelet on 
 her right wrist and revels a peculiar marking that starts to glow 
 an eerie blue. Erika stumbles back off of her stool in astonishment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Grabbing the young woman's hand) You will</p>

<div class="stage">Snapping back to the present, Dr. von Meer wipes a tear from her eye and returns to work on her computer. She sends an instant message to Morrigan.</div>
