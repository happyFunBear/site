      <h1>Year 2, Chapter 5: Moonlight Observations</h1>
      <p>Morrigan continues to take walks along the beach, hoping to encounter Darkfin but runs into Karl Senior instead. Awhile later, Darkfin finally appears. Morrigan is tested with the trident as two hooded figures observe. Darkfin takes them on with her new power and escapes with Morrigan in the car.</p>

<div class="stage">Walking barefoot along the shores of Duquesa Bay, Morrigan McBride stares out to sea as nighttime joggers and dog walkers
  pass by. She glances down at her watch as the High Tide tickles her toes.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself) Alrighty, Miss Mermaid, where are you? - I have been waiting for over a week now... it's
  not like we can just exchange e-mails</p>

<div class="stage">She searches the waves and finds nothing. As a slight breeze begins to blow, the petite brunette suddenly feels a presence
  behind her and whips around.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh, Mr. von Meer... it's nice to see you again</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c05_karl_sr_beach.jpg" h="556" w="420" b="0" a="center"/>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Ambling up to her) Hello, Morrigan - out for an evening stroll?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Something like that</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> It's good exercise, or so my wife tells me... I have to keep a watch on the old cholesterol</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan smiles as the man sighs and pats his stomach.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> I'm not interrupting you, am I?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not at all, I'm just enjoying some quiet time</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Looking around) I don't see any handsome young man in your presence</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> KJ's taking me for a sail this weekend</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Who says I was talking about my son - AHA, go ahead and tell him I said that!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Nodding) I'll be sure to do so</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Seriously, I'm a little concerned - it's not safe for a pretty young lady to be out here all alone, we've
  had some... incidents lately</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know, I've been reporting on them</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> You sure have - great piece on the PCOC conference, by the way</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Do you have mace?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh, I appreciate your concern, Mr. von Meer...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> KARL, please</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Karl - but my father's an LAPD commander, I learned self defense techniques before I could ride a bike</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> I'm glad to hear that but I still think you should have mace... or at least a German Sheppard</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll take that into consideration</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Good, I like you, more importantly, my son likes you - I want to see your smiling face at my dinner table...
  it would be a pleasant change from the usual female faces I have my dinner table</p>

<div class="stage">Picturing a scowling Erika and her mother, Morrigan can't help but chuckle.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Speaking of which, I better get back home before Pauline comes after me with a net</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Annette?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> NO, A NET... literally - she'd grab the net off of the tennis court and hunt me down</p>

<div class="stage">The older man becomes animated.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> KARL, I TOLD YOU TO BE BACK BY TEN, AAAARRRRGGGHHH</p>

<div class="stage">As the senior von Meer contorts his face into a strangulation appearance, Morrigan is practically in tears laughing.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Heading off) Have a good night, little lady, and be sure to stop by the house more often - don't let
  the womenfolk scare you away!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself as she waves goodbye) It's not the womenfolk that scare me</p>

<div class="stage">Once again alone, Morrigan tracks a bit further down the beach, finally resting near some dunes. Two hooded figures, covertly
  observing the woman, whisper to each other.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Hood #1</span> Do you think she will appear tonight?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Hood #2</span> She cannot keep away much longer - if she finally does, we are only to report back what we have witnessed</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Hood #1</span> I do not understand such logic</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Hood #2</span> It is not for us to understand, only to obey... I need to take my forward position</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c05_morri_beach.jpg" h="285" w="620" b="0"/>


<div class="stage">Time passes as Morrigan dreamily regards the night sky and traces circles in the sand with her fingertips, unaware of the
  hooded figure a few yards away.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Softly) This is almost as peaceful as Montana</p>

<div class="stage">Rising out of the surf, directly in front of her, is Darkfin.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y1c05_df_water.jpg" h="578" w="420" b="0" a="center"/>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Almost</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin saunters over to where Morrigan is sitting and kneels on the sand before her.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Scooting back) Holy Mackerel</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Actually, mackerel is only 0.2% of my DNA</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, sorry - I should pay more attention to those &quot;identify the fish&quot; charts hanging in Captain
  Dave's Seafood Shack</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Eying the pattern Morrigan has made in the sand) Not a very effective sand castle</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who says it's a sand castle... maybe it's the design for a sand castle</p>

<div class="stage">The two stare at each other in silence for a moment.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking a deep breath) Sorry, I know you've saved my life but you still freak me out - Zach and Gracie
  are the sci-fi fans, this is all just a little too weird for me... especially with that nagging issue called murder</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You call it murder, I call it depopulation</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's sick!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Then, why are you here?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan looks puzzled.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Why are you here waiting for me?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OH, PLEASE... I enjoy taking walks along the beach!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You do not appear to be walking</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I am RESTING</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Starting to get up) My apologies, I shall leave you to your rest</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing Darkfin's arm) NO, WAIT</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is momentarily mesmerized by the feel of the cold, sleek scales and notices a tiny electrical current pass between
  their touch. She is halted from exploring the arm fins as Darkfin draws back.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My turn to apologize, I have a nasty curiosity habit</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That can be good... and bad</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Well, since I have you here, I would like to ask you a few questions</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I will answer yours if you will answer just one of mine</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sounds fair - but I get to go first</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That is reasonable</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OK... where do you come from, what are you doing, when did this begin, why is this happening, how many
  others are like you and who in the HELL were those robe people in the cave?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Are you done?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> For this breath</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I come from the sea, I defend those who cannot defend themselves, I was doing this before your arrival,
  I am the only one of my kind and I am not certain who the robed people in the cave are</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> THOSE ARE REALLY CRAPPY ANSWERS</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Maybe, but they are answers nonetheless... my turn</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Throwing up her arms) AHH</p>

<div class="stage">Slowly reaching down, Darkfin clasps Morrigan's left ankle and rubs her thumb along the arch of her foot. The triskele mark
  glows at the touch as the petite brunette becomes warm and lightheaded.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pulling her foot away) It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> A rather elaborate birthmark</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know - my father wanted to have it removed but my mother insisted that I keep it... why?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin now stands up and summons her trident. It comes flying out of the ocean and lands solidly in her palm.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's a nifty trick - I have one, too!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan touches the tip of her nose with her tongue.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Impressive... be sure to put that on your resume</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I would LOVE to see your resume</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Twirling her trident) May I try something?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, you haven't bought me dinner yet</p>

<div class="stage">Plunging her fist into the shore, Darkfin pulls up several sand crabs and pops a few into her mouth. She offers one to a
  repulsed Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> DISGUSTING</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Walking away) Do you not eat sushi?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO, I watch people eat sushi as I devour my well-cooked teriyaki chicken!</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin turns around and abruptly hurls her trident at Morrigan. It veers off at the last second as the woman screams.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I CAN LEARN TO LOVE SUSHI</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Returning to her side) We will work on your wasabi tolerance later</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Um, why did you just try to kill me?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I was not trying to kill you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> REALLY? - is that the new Nerf spear?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Even if you did not repel it, it would have missed your head by three centimeters</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm glad someone is good at math!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I needed to make sure</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still shaking) Make sure of what? - why did I repel it? - I know I'm not in my best clothes tonight but
  there are no mountainous zits on my face</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Pointing to the trident) Try summoning it</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You heard me</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do I whistle or should I use a piece of cheese?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Try suspending the sarcasm for five seconds and concentrate</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You're serious</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin says nothing as she stares at the woman before her.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sighing) I suppose I have nothing better to do</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Five seconds</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Folding her arms) FINE</p>

<div class="stage">Closing her eyes and concentrating, Morrigan tries to summon the trident to her hand.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's not working</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Keep trying</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHY?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I need to prepare you for a return to the caves</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OH NO, nonononono - I have no intention of returning to those caves until I have a division of tanks with
  me</p>

<div class="stage">With a slight twitch, the trident flies out of the sand and into Morrigan's hand.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That will do</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Shocked) Did you do that?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It was all you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Regarding the beautiful weapon) It's so light... and warm - I don't understand?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Patience</p>

<div class="stage">Behind a sandy knoll, one of the hooded figures observes the two of them. Darkfin sensed it long ago but deliberately ignored
  the situation until now.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Coming close into Morrigan's face) Remain still</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What... what are you doing?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Not breaking eye contact with her) Remain calm</p>

<div class="stage">Inserting her fingertips into both of Morrigan's ears, Darkfin lets loose with a concussive wave. The blow knocks out the
  hooded figure, as well as stunning its initiator.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Jumping up) WHAT IN THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Motioning to behind the knoll) We were being watched by our friends from the caves</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> DID YOU JUST... HOW DID YOU...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Dizzy) RUN</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> THERE ARE OTHERS COMING, RUN</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I CAN'T LEAVE YOU HERE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> GO, NOW</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin pushes the woman forward and then hurls the trident into the ocean. Morrigan takes off running as she spots two hooded
  figures closing in behind her. Darkfin goes after them.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (At full stride) Mr. von Meer was right, I really wish I had some mace right now!</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c05_df_fight.jpg" h="483" w="420" b="0"/>


<div class="stage">Tackling one of the hoods, Darkfin is sent flying into the sand by the other. All three continue to battle each other for
  some time.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (To the hood in front of her) This is pointless!</p>

<div class="stage">A hood jumps directly in back of her.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Hood</span> We'll see!</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, a white Mustang roars along the surf's edge, flashing its lights and blaring the horn. The driver's door flies
  open and slams into the back of one of the hoods, sending him soaring into the sand.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> C'MON, LET'S GO</p>

<div class="stage">Taking her suggestion, Darkfin flips onto the top of the vehicle and grabs a secure hold with her hands. With a sharp acceleration,
  the car fishtails in the sand and zooms off along the beach, leaving the hoods behind. Now back on open road, Morrigan
  finally steadies her breathing and racing heart.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Opening the moon roof) Dad told me to never pick up hitchhikers!</p>

<div class="stage">Crawling in through the passenger window, Darkfin takes a seat in silence.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Did they hurt you?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Rubbing her eyes) What?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why are your ears bleeding?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Pull the car over on that bridge!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Doing so) We need to talk some more</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Jumping out) I need to leave... you need to return home</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WAIT</p>

<div class="stage">With one deft move, Darkfin dives off of the bridge and into the water below.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> E-MAIL ME</p>
