<div class="stage">Deep inside the undersea caverns of Concha Dos Island, Dr. Erika von Meer works in her lair, conducting studies and restocking
    supplies. As she sets down a beaker and passes by a tank holding a Dorado fish, the scientist opens a wooden chest and
    lovingly regards a bracelet made of carved shells. She then takes out a large, aged book and flips through the pages
    written in an ancient text.</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sighing) How naive was I, Sam? - it was only a matter of time and now that time is here</p>

<div class="stage">She turns to a page that bears the same symbol as the one on the bottom of Morrigan's foot.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c02_book_page.jpg" h="332" w="370"  b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> And now I have more to protect than what was originally estimated</p>

<div class="stage">Slamming the book closed and returning it to the chest, Erika now focuses on an experiment. She writes up some notes and
    then takes out a mini tape recorder.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Speaking into it) The science behind the transmogrification is complex but not unfathomable... I wish
    I could say the same about the Nereidium</p>

<div class="stage">She glances over her shoulder at the trident leaning against a cave wall. Erika extends her hand and beckons it to her grasp
    where she twirls it around and practices a defensive maneuver.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> If I am to be victorious over this new enemy, I must be better prepared with better weapons... therefore,
    I am about to test a new capability</p>

<div class="stage">She hurls the trident into the water and hooks herself up to several monitors that record her vitals signs.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> My morphs have been stable enough now to consider additional synths... although I do not look forward to
    increased headaches and nausea</p>

<div class="stage">The lithe blonde takes a syringe and injects herself. Clinching her teeth and inhaling deeply, she feels a slow burn run
    up her arm and spread throughout her body. The monitors record the sudden fluctuation in her vitals. Moments later, she
    untangles the wires from her body and strips off the remainder of her clothes.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> How well this works depends on a number of factors... most of which will be under my control</p>

<div class="stage">Erika pauses the tape and sets some timers on her watch. Running up a cliff inside the cave, she dives off into the pool
    of seawater that leads out into Duquesa Bay. Her typical morph into Darkfin takes place in its usual pattern as she heads
    into deeper ocean waters. There, she emits a small, concussive wave that stuns the schools of fish surrounding her. She
    grabs a few of the fish and quickly devours them down to the bones.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c02_df_swimming.jpg" h="389" w="668"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">Satisfied with the results, Darkfin returns to her lair, covers herself in her lab coat and promptly expels salt crystals
    out of her nostrils.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Slipping on her glasses) That wasn't too bad</p>

<div class="stage">The scientist resumes monitoring herself and writes up the notes.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Looking at a tank full of fish) Now comes the real test...</p>

<div class="stage">She emits another concussive wave through vocalization, stunning the fish in the tank and shattering a few of the glass tubes
    on her table.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Wincing and short of breath) YES... it worked... out of water... as well</p>

<div class="stage">The scientist resumes tape recording her thoughts.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> The sequence of low-frequency bangs or clicks... small sonic booms if you will... was highly effective
    in its first trial, far exceeding my original expectations - length and duration will need further study</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c02_df_science.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">She shuts off the tape recorder and checks the contents of a flask.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Half smirk) My detractors at Woods Hole would not be pleased</p>

<div class="stage">On her computer is a real-time feed of KCON's evening news broadcast. Morrigan McBride is seen interviewing Griffin Martel
    about the Pacific Coast Oil Consortium's annual meeting.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Studying the screen) But I still have a ways to go, Sammy... a long way</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, the green form falls to the ground and is overtaken by an epileptic seizure.</div>
