<div class="stage">In the early morning hours, Erika awakens from her nap in the hospital basement and, still disguised in surgical scrubs, sneaks into a medical supply room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rummaging through a cabinet) I have got to order more of these supplies so I won't have to keep doing this</p>

<div class="stage">She finds a bag containing the right amount of saline, potassium, and other minerals she needs and opens an IV line on herself. As she monitors the drip, she immediately feels better and notices the fins and scales receding.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sighing) About time!</p>

<div class="stage">As the blonde woman runs her fingers through her hair while continuing to receive the nutrients in the other arm, she ponders the events of last night.</div>


<img class="add-modal"  b="1" h="267" w="180" src="assets/images/y1c8_infusion.jpg" alt="Erika in the Hospital (by Alex Amezcua)" a="middle"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't understand - my behavior pattern has deviated drastically - why did I bother to save that McBride girl and why didn't I just kill that pain in the ass Fiore?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika sits cross-legged on the floor and begins to meditate as the last of the solution enters her vein. Suddenly, Dr. Stephanie Gates Martel, an elegant woman with a bent nose, enters the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Calling back to a nurse) Room 346 needs an EKG, I'll get some...</p>

<div class="stage">She is startled by the site of Erika in the corner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Hold on, I'll be right back!</p>

<div class="stage">She calmly closes the door behind her and walks over to the now standing Dr. von Meer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Silent at first) Erika... you have 10 seconds to talk me out of calling security</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm sorry, Stephanie, I know how bad this looks but I needed help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Why didn't you come to the emergency room?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You know my family would find out if I did that - they don't need to be worried unnecessarily</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Studying the young woman's face) Should they be worried?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Defensive) NO, I went for a swim in the ocean yesterday, pushed myself too much and became dehydrated - I ignored the symptoms because of the spill last night, I had a lot of work to do - this morning, I blacked out for a little bit, knew what was wrong, so I came over here to fix it... end of story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> If you didn't want to go to the emergency room, why didn't you just come see me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I thought you'd be too busy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Suddenly softening) Honey, I'm never too busy for you - I think of you as one of my own children - for Godsakes, Erika, I delivered you!</p>

<div class="stage">Taking the needle out of her arm, the younger woman smiles at the thought of the often-told family story about the disastrous von Meer &amp; Martel yachting vacation in the South Seas.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Taking out her stethoscope) Let me just check you over real quick</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Hesitant at first but allowing her to do so) I'm better now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> You're still palpitating and your blood pressure is too low, I want you to stay here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Pushing away) I'll be fine, I promise to go right home and get some sleep</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I think I know your secret</p>

<div class="stage">Erika freezes and looks back at Dr. Martel.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Answer me honestly, are you on drugs?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> ABSOLUTELY NOT - you know I've seen too many of my friends and family get burned by them, I am not using, I swear to you, Stephanie!</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="248" w="235" src="assets/images/erika_headshot_new.gif" a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Looking her in the eye) I can always tell when you're lying to me, Erika, I believe you... but, if it's not drugs, what is it? - Griff tells me you're acting so strange lately</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's nothing a little rest and relaxation won't take care of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> My son can help you there</p>

<div class="stage">Erika gives her a chilly glance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Sorry, I had to try... look, I need to get back to my rounds - I don't EVER want to catch you doing this again, do you understand? - just because your family is a major contributor to this hospital doesn't entitle you to break in and steal supplies whenever you want them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Of course - I will make full remuneration for these supplies</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I'll take care of it - from now on, Erika, if you're in trouble and need help, please come to me immediately... whatever it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Raising an eyebrow) In that case, may I please borrow a dollar for a cup of tea?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Sighing and opening her wallet) I'm guessing you don't have money for a cab, either - take my car keys and go home after you get your tea!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking the money and the keys) Thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Concerned look) You're welcome</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside her hospital room, Morrigan continues to dream about the events of the night when she is disturbed by the ring of the phone next to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half awake) Huh... hello?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hey Morri, it's Gracie - are you awake?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm assuming so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> How are you feeling, M&amp;M?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Zach?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I conferenced him in, listen, you are not even going to BELIEVE what I found on those back-up tapes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm kind of thinking I will</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> We're on our way to bust you out and we'll go over it then</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="233" w="354" src="assets/images/y1c8_hospital_corridor.jpg" alt="Hospital Hallway" a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's all well and good but I REALLY need to get my stuff from the rich guy's place and go over to the house I'm renting before the landlord thinks I flaked and gives it to someone else</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> No problem, we'll swing by and do all that later but you have to see this footage!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Where is this house you're renting?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have the number in my purse but I know it's on Willowbrook</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> OH SHIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What's wrong with Willowbrook?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Let me guess - is your landlord's name Amethyst Hill?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How did you know that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> SORRY, I'M NOT GOING OVER THERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> &quot;Amy&quot; is one of Zach's many ex-girlfriends - she mentioned that she was renting her guest cottage to some sucker from the Midwest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's nice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'M NEVER GOING OVER THERE AGAIN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> The outside of the place is very nondescript but INSIDE...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> DAMN HANGING DOORWAY BEADS NEARLY KILLED ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It looks like Barney the Dinosaur downed a dozen pitchers of grape juice and exploded all over the walls</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her head) Lovely</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> AND THE CATS, OH MY GOD, THE CATS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You know what, guys, I need to take a urine specimen, I'll see you both when you get here - BYE</p>

<div class="stage">The petite brunette hangs up the phone and sighs. She rolls over and is surprised by Dr. Stephanie Martel standing over her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> AAHH - sorry, doctor, I didn't see you standing there... I don't really need to take a urine specimen, do I?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Looking at a chart) No, Ms. McBride, you're fine - in fact, I just signed your release forms, you're free to leave whenever you want - I just need to see you back here in a week for a routine follow-up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Shaking her hand) Thank you, Dr. Martel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I look forward to seeing you on the news... this time, as a reporter!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan smiles as she leaves. The phone rings again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Answering) Hello? - no, Dad, you two do NOT need to come up here, I'm fine... listen to me... Dad - NO - DAMMIT</p>

<div class="stage">The woman slams down the phone and flops against the bed. Lieutenant Anita Fiore calls to her from the other side of the curtain.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Pssst</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan tries to ignore her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> PSSSSSST</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself) Why can't everyone just leave me alone?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Throwing back the curtain) HEY, MCBRIDE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> MAY I HELP YOU, LIEUTENANT FIORE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> So, you remember me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How could I forget?</p>

<div class="stage">The chiseled, raven-haired woman is all smiles.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That wasn't a compliment... what do you want?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Do you know what happened to you last night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have a pretty good idea</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> So, she saved you, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You know whom I'm talking about</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, I do NOT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Listen, you were unconscious when you went into the water... how did you make it to the river bank?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Seeing flashes of the hand in her head) A guardian angel, I suppose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm supposing it was Aleta Oscura</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sorry Lieutenant...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Please, call me Anita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Anita... despite my two years of Spanish in high school, I only remember a few words - &quot;Aleta&quot; and &quot;Oscura&quot; are not two of them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking directly at Morrigan) DARK FIN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Darkfin, she's the one who saved you - but, the question is, why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm always up for a good story but this isn't making any sense... do you have a concussion?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Your &quot;Miss Innocent&quot; routine works well on people because of your cute little face but I know you know EXACTLY what I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know I'm wishing I had a private room right now!</p>

<div class="stage">An attractive young nurse enters and goes over to Morrigan's side.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> Ms. McBride, I have some papers for you to fill out before you leave</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="227" w="180" src="assets/images/nurse.gif" alt='&quot;Hello Nurse!&quot;' a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Reluctantly taking them) Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">The nurse saunters over to Anita's bedside and closes the curtain behind her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> Don't you have a gig at Muldoon's every Friday night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Every other Friday - I do it to make some extra cash</p>

<div class="stage">A perplexed Morrigan listens to the conversation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> You're amazing with that guitar, such nimble fingers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> I love your rendition of Bruce Springsteen's &quot;I'm On Fire&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'll sing it for you privately sometime</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> (Getting a tub of warm water) I look forward to that - I've always had a thing for musicians</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan screws up her face in disbelief as she realizes what's happening.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> (Seductively climbing on the lieutenant's bed) Are you ready for your sponge bath?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I think you should know that I'm in a committed relationship... we'll be celebrating our third week anniversary tomorrow night... um... ooh, that feels good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Covering her head with the pillow in vain) I need to get out of here!</p>

<div class="stage">She hops out of bed, throws on a blue paper robe with matching booties, and scoots quickly out the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I need some hot chocolate... I need some hot chocolate... I need some hot chocolate</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Standing at the vending machine, Erika inserts the dollar bill and makes her selection only to hear a whirring sound with no results.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Banging it) OH, C'MON</p>

<div class="stage">The machine repeats the whirring sound with no results.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Leaning her head against it and sighing) I can swim faster than a sailfish and yet I cannot get a CUP... OF... TEA</p>

<div class="stage">The machine whirs again and finally releases a cup, filling it slowly.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Thank you</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="194" w="120" src="assets/images/y1c8_coffeemachine.gif" alt="Coffee Machine" a="center"/>


<div class="stage">The woman takes the cup and sips it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Scowling) Cold, of course</p>

<div class="stage">As she goes to round the corner, Morrigan slams into her, spilling the contents all over each of them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Jumping back) AAAHHHH... wait, it's cold</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Still scowling) Yes, it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm so sorry, doctor, I wasn't watching where I was going... you see, I nearly died last night saving a dog... I was rescued by something along the lines of Big Foot and El Chupacabra... I have two new best friends who won't leave me alone... I hate the nickname &quot;M&amp;M&quot; although the alternative &quot;Button Nose&quot; is worse... I want to sleep in my own bed - not in a hospital one, not on someone's couch, and not in my car... I am apparently going to live in a funky feline purple palace... my father and his bimbo wife are driving up to see me because they think I can't take care of myself... I really wish I had my mom right now but that's impossible... I don't know if my insurance is going to cover this... all of my stuff is in the driveway of some rich snob... and there's a kinky sponge bath going on in my room!</p>

<div class="stage">Erika stares at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Extending her hand) Hello, I'm Morrigan McBride, nice to meet you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Shaking it lightly) Erika von Meer</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan gets an odd feeling and looks closely at Erika's hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Quickly pulling it away) If you'll excuse me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh my God, it's YOU</p>

<div class="stage">The blood drains from Erika's face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> VON MEER, that's your driveway, I deeply apologize about the snob comment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Exhaling) No worries</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why are you dressed like that?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika glares disparagingly at Morrigan's paper booties.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I mean, Gracie told me you had your Ph.D. but she didn't mention you were a doctor doctor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I am not a medical doctor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Then, why are you dressed like one?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Always the investigative reporter?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Only when I see something that doesn't make sense</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You'll be busy in this town</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Tell me about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> If you must know, I was here conducting an experiment - unfortunately, it got all over my clothes, similar to the way the tea has now - fortunately, Dr. Martel lent me this outfit until I can go home and change</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I like Dr. Martel, she's a nice lady</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Indeed she is, now do you have any more questions or am I free to leave?</p>

<div class="stage">Before Morrigan can find the right words, Erika turns around and starts to walk away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Stopping) Oh, and please remove your belongings out of our driveway before my mother has an aneurysm... thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nice to have met you...</p>

<div class="stage">The green-eyed woman makes sure that the blue-eyed one is out of ear shot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> BITCH OF THE UNIVERSE... God, what is WITH these people in this town? - I'm starting to miss the cows back in Montana!</p>

<div class="stage">Inside the caverns of the Kiyomis, a procession of cloaked figures gathers in a chamber.
