<div class="stage">Aboard the USCG patrol boat &quot;Catalina,&quot; Captain Craig Phelps and Lieutenant Anita Fiore comb the mid-afternoon waters of Duquesa Bay, looking for clues about Darkfin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Studying a map with handwritten notes on it) We should be doing this at night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Cleaning his sunglasses) You know how expensive nighttime operations are, lieutenant</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I think solving the mystery of Aleta Oscura is worth a few extra greenbacks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Greenbacks we need to justify before a board - a board consists of more than one person - multiple people privy to this information means assholes like Isaacson get to ride us like ponies</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I won't mind taking Kylee for a ride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Checking some equipment) It's good to know you never let go of an obsession, Fiore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> At least I'm upfront about mine - tell them to head northeast at half speed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> We've been over this same section of the grid for days now, what exactly are you expecting to find?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Something... anything</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c03_craig_atsea.jpg" h="409" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Are you going to throw a few tuna lures out there and hope she takes the bait?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I have triangulated all of the major Darkfin sightings, went back and did some calculations on the weather patterns, water temps, schools of fish...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Stunned) YOU did all of that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Sheepish) I had a little help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Ah, and does this &quot;Little Help&quot; have big boobs?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> OK, I'm screwing this marine biology student to help me with the research</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Cringing) Eech, crunchy granola!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> But, like the snack, she's quick and easy and is most beneficial in assisting me - taste is not the important thing here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Heh - you ARE keeping her in the dark about the subject matter... pun intended</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Winking) Of course, she just thinks I like dolphins</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Laughing and shaking his head) Aw, man - hey, why didn't you ask your brother-in-law for help instead?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Actually, this student came from Sandy as a personal reference, if you get my drift</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Slamming down his fist on the rail) THAT SLIME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Craig, seriously, nothing would make me happier than to see my sister dump that asswipe for you but that's not going to happen... they have kids together</p>

<div class="stage">The captain is silent for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You know, there are a couple of fine-looking ladies at the gym that have asked about &quot;my superior&quot; - want me to hook you up?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I can find my own dates, Anita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Then, do so... soon</p>

<div class="stage">Aboard their yacht, &quot;Dream Doer,&quot; Doug Martel and his wife Ursula are below in the master cabin as a wrap party for the TV show &quot;Sigma 7&quot; rages above them on deck. Sprawled out on a king-sized bed in a tiny black bikini, numerous gold chains and large Versace sunglasses, the woman behind R'xal, Queen of the Warrior Moons, clutches her head and moans. Her husband, wearing khaki shorts and a red Hawaiian shirt massages her feet as he sips a Pina Colada.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Explain to me, Dougie, why must you look like an American Tourist?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I could wear Speedos if you would prefer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> You would frighten the guests... maybe that's a good idea</p>

<div class="stage">The older man chuckles and checks his cell phone for messages. Ursula abruptly kicks it out of his hand and shoves her foot in his face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> PAY ATTENTION TO ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Rubbing her foot) Are you still seasick?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Baby voice) I don't know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Well, do you still feel like tossing your cookies all over Marcy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Suddenly sitting up) I feel like that all the time!</p>

<div class="stage">The former supermodel and Yugoslav native grabs her husband and starts to kiss him passionately while trying to undo his pants.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Um, I sure hope you don't feel like that right now</p>

<div class="stage">A short while later, Ursula wipes her mouth with a tissue as Doug lies back on the bed with a wide grin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Stroking his wife's back) Can I, uh, return the favor?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Don't touch me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Quickly pulling away) Right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> I want Marcy killed off</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c03_ursula_in_bed.jpg" h="472" w="470"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Sighing) Not that again, Urs - how many times have we been through this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> She annoys me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> They ALL annoy you but we can't keep killing them off... with Rojilio gone, we are now down to three lead players - this USED to be an ensemble show!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> But I am THE star</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Sipping his drink) No one is disputing that but the audience loves the tension between R'xal and Bogree - it's the classic hero/villain theme and we can't afford to lose that right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Write another character similar to hers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Holding his forehead) We have tried that but none of them have caught on like Bogree - people just love Marcy... and she knows it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Pouting) That's what I don't understand - we've buried her under tons of ugly make-up and made her &quot;good&quot; and the audience still adores her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> When people see her out of make-up at interviews and conventions they are absolutely wowed by her personality...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Take a few conventions away from her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> We need the publicity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Well then, increase MINE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> You hate doing conventions</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> True... I do not know where their hands have been</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> The big thing with Marcy is that a lot of them remember her from &quot;Life's Little Lessons&quot; - you can't squash that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Damn stupid sitcom... when am I getting my own sitcom?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> We're working on it, Babe</p>

<div class="stage">The woman flops back down on the bed and thinks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> You know, this has been our strongest season to date - the ratings are solid, we were nominated in the special effects category - we should all be very proud of that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Hmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I was scared shitless when we moved production down here from Vancouver but it worked out well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Admiring her toes) I suppose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Just remember, Marcy was a former child star, YOU were an international supermodel!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> AND A MEMBER OF ROYALTY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Rolling his eyes) Of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> There is no contest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Smiling) That's right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Pulling down her bikini top) Make love to me now!</p>

<div class="stage">The two begin to kiss.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> As long as she stays hidden under that hideous latex, I will be happy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Oh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> OH?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Well, um, she kind of hinted that next season, she wants to be made a little more &quot;human&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> ARE YOU KIDDING ME? - STOP SQUEEZING MY BREASTS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> WHO IN THE HELL DOES SHE THINK SHE IS? - SHE PORTRAYS A FRIGGING FROG CREATURE, SHE CANNOT LOOK HUMAN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Honey</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> ABSOLUTELY NOT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> You know this is the time she can renegotiate certain aspects of her contract</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Give her a raise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> We can't afford large raises right now because of the cost of moving our production base - and she realizes that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> DUMB BITCH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Actually, she's very smart and very shrewd - if we don't go along with the lighter make-up, she wants her own M-O-W</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> A MOVIE OF THE WEEK? - HOW DARE SHE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> You will still be getting two of your own</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (On the verge of tears) I HATE HER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Don't cry, you'll ruin your mascara</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Composing herself) Alright</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Pulling her close to him) Listen, your M-O-W's will be on the network and will have an &quot;ER&quot; star attached to one of them - Marcy's will be on basic cable and she will be working with Randolph Mantooth</p>

<div class="stage">Ursula ponders this for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Sliding down her bikini bottom) See, now don't I look after my girl?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Crawling on top of him) Yes, Baby, you do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Good, now let's do this fast, I don't want to miss out on the limbo contest</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">On the main deck, as partiers dance and drink around her, Marcy Nolan sits in the corner with a large straw hat, a wide stripe of zinc oxide across her nose, and a cell phone glued to her ear.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c03_marcy_atsea.jpg" h="411" w="370"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Look, Mortie, I told you to dump those tech stocks - how are the overseas markets shaping up? - no, I do NOT want to talk show biz shop right now, you're my manager, you're supposed to be my evil agent AND my money man - now quit whining and do your fuckin' job already!</p>

<div class="stage">Ned, Ms. Nolan's blond Australian fianc&eacute;, rushes over to her with a large fish.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> Isn't it killer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> It's a fish</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> It's a barracuda!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Like we don't have enough of those on this boat</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> It nearly took me wrist off dragging it in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Back to her conversation) Mortie, I'll have to call you back when this hellish day comes to an end... Ned, do you smell smoke?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> It's probably just the barbie, Luv</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> No, this does not smell like grilled shrimp</p>

<div class="stage">As she puts her cell phone away and Ned starts dancing around with his fish, the &quot;Dream Doer&quot; captain rushes over and blows a whistle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Is P.E. over so soon?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Captain</span> May I have everyone's attention please - we have had a minor incident with the engine... it's sort of burning</p>

<div class="stage">One of the starlets notices dark smoke coming from the stern.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Starlet</span> OHMIGOD, THE BOAT IS ON FIRE, EEEEEKKK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Isn't this just perfect</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> Crikey, I wanted to fish some more!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Captain</span> PLEASE, PLEASE, no one panic - everything is contained, there's a Coast Guard cutter on its way to assist us, just please put you life jackets on and stay towards the bow, thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> I wonder where Ursula and Doug are?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> She's probably still below, running her lines on his dick</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> (Helping her with an orange life jacket) Do you think I can still keep me barracuda?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Patting his arm) We'll see</p>

<div class="stage">Craig and Anita's ship pulls up to the disabled yacht and they come aboard. After securing the engine and doing a check of everything else, they return to the deck with Doug and Ursula and speak with the guests. They start to issue citations to some of the obviously inebriated partiers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Heh, this day keeps on getting better and better - now, we have to deal with Coasties!</p>

<div class="stage">Lieutenant Fiore, hearing the slang term for Coast Guard personnel, turns around and locks eyes with Ms. Nolan. She struts over to the actress who is still in her orange life jacket and straw hat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking at her face) Nice stripe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Are you done playing high seas cop?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Not quite - that's a non-reg PFD you're wearing... a costly violation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Half smile) It's not my boat, I don't give a damn!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking at her closer) Oh wow - aren't you...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Quickly) No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Full smile) YEAH, YOU ARE - YOU'RE JAMIE FROM &quot;LIFE'S LITTLE LESSONS&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> I WAS Jamie from &quot;Life's Little Lessons&quot; - that was nearly a decade ago, I have since moved on from that character, I would suggest you do the same</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Of course, now you're some space frog, correct?</p>

<div class="stage">The two scowl at each other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Why don't you talk a walk, Coastie?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Quit calling me that or I'll keep calling you Jamie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> My father was a REAL military officer, he was a Navy SEAL - and you're run by... what is it again? - the Department of Agriculture?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Turning red in the face) The Department of Transportation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Ah, right - look, Lieutenant Fire-eye - it was fun chatting but I really want this day to end and you're just prolonging the misery</p>

<div class="stage">Anita places her hand on the rail of the ship and leans in towards Marcy's face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Not until I get a breathalyzer test from you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Suddenly noticing Anita's bracelet) That's... that's beautiful - where did you get it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Softening a bit) It's a family heirloom</p>

<div class="stage">Marcy suddenly traces her fingertips along the star's points.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Nice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Um... why don't you come on the patrol boat with us, we can get you back to land sooner</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can answer, Ned sneaks up behind Marcy and grabs her into a hug.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ned</span> Hey, I was just talking with Doug, once me fish is stuffed and mounted, he'll have one of his companies put in some kind of electronic gizmo that will make it sing along to &quot;Men At Work&quot; songs - won't that be wicked?</p>

<div class="stage">Marcy sighs as Anita looks on horrified.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Thanks for the offer, lieutenant, but I suppose I should stay here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I understand, you'll all be on your way shortly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You're more than welcome</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Back aboard the &quot;Catalina,&quot; Craig finishes a conversation with one of his officers as Anita sits silently at a control panel.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You're awfully quiet, lieutenant</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Just thinking...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Well, think about THIS, I scored the numbers of THREE, count them, THREE starlets from the yacht!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Women love to be rescued by studs in uniform</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That's not the best part... Mrs. Martel herself grabbed my ass as I was leaving</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Gazing off) Good going, Crunch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Now sitting next to her) OK, why are you suddenly in this funk? - what are you thinking?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I think... I'm in love</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Oh no, no</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Singsong voice) It's Jamie!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Not another one of your crushes, Fiore - haven't you learned from the Shepperton one?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> But Ms. Nolan and I had a moment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> And did her buff Aussie beau share in this moment?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> He's a pretty boy beard</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You always assume that - for once, just once, stick with one obsession at a time... I think Darkfin is more than enough right now, don't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Admiring her bracelet) Maybe</p>
