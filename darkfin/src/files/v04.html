<div class="stage">Inside her darkened room with Clan of Xymox blaring from the stereo, Penelope Renselier reclines on her bed and scrawls in a notebook. Her boyfriend, Jeremy Colvin, sits on the floor and sketches a dragon on his skateboard.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/v04_pennys_room.jpg" h="421" w="470"  b="0">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> This band sucks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> DOES NOT - your retro techno shit does</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Hey, I'm creating a special Tori/NIN mix for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Bouncing) COOL - when do I get to hear it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Soon, I want to run it by Grace, first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Sighing) Why do you have to?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> She IS my mentor and I trust her ear</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> At least she has two of those</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> That's harsh, Pen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> What, because my mom's a cripple, I'm supposed to be all politically correct and sympathetic? - yeah, right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> You nearly decapitate people when they stare at your mom at the mall</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> That's different - I made my comment about Gracie in private, I didn't go up to her in public and call her lobster claw</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Still sketching) And that's supposed to be better?</p>

<div class="stage">Penny throws her notepad at Jeremy's head. He takes it and looks at what she was writing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Is this a new poem?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Could be - I might turn it into lyrics</p>

<div class="stage">Now standing on her bed, she recites the words in a brutal, animated tone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> A glaze of malaise over my days<br>
 Has me in a constant haze<br>
 Is it just a simple phase?<br>
 Maybe so in many ways<br>
 What can I do to end this craze?<br>
 Sing to you with heartfelt praise<br>
 Or run with the sun on its outstretched rays<br>
 Your stoic gaze forever stays!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Nice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Half grin) Thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Looking at her notebook) Except &quot;it's&quot; is wrong</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> FUCK YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Smiling) If you went to English class, you would know better - Mrs. Lopez says you have a real gift with languages, you just need discipline... and a college education</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> FUCK HER... college is NOT for me - why do I want to whore my script muses to corporate America? - so I can buy an ugly tract house and write horrid product copy for a living? - I might as well slash my wrists now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Unfortunately, that's how the world works</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Someone else's world, not mine!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Look, I am struggling to get a stupid GED while you sit and waste your talent, banking on your family's bank account to spare your sorry ass</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> That is SO not true</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> You know damn well you can easily go to work with your mom at the museum or have your dad place you at one of his political cronies' companies... heh, my mom would kill for an opportunity like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I could have my folks make a few phone calls</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> NO, she EARNS her job - it's not like she knows the wife of the CEO and is instantly handed a director's title</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I am TOTALLY tired of nice people getting screwed - your mom is a great lady who just made a few bad choices when she was younger and now she's supposed to pay for them for the rest of her life?</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy sits in silence as Penny slides down off the bed beside him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> And my mother, for all of her annoying faults, is a good soul who played by the rules and is rewarded with a chronic illness that will ultimately wither her away</p>

<div class="stage">Penny's voice reveals a slight tremor causing Jeremy to give her a hug.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> My father has to hide behind me and mom to cover his homosexuality because society, his society, won't accept him... meanwhile, brainless weasels like Byron's family are getting away with murder because they have the proper connections and loopholes to do so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I know, it's disgusting</p>

<div class="stage">Taking out a new pen, Jeremy begins to illustrate Penny's poem in the notebook.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Solipsistic scum drinking their Starbucks, driving their SUVs with cell phones stuffed in their ears, I want to take a magic machete and chop off all of their heads... decorate my backyard with them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> They don't really fit the motif of your backyard</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I'd just hollow out their skulls for potted plants</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Rolling his eyes) Ah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Watching him) For a brilliant artist, you aren't very artist-y with your Weltschmerz</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I'll be dying my hair three shades of blue tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Better</p>

<div class="stage">Penny's cell phone goes off and she checks the voicemail message.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Groaning) It's Vesper, she's too nauseas to come over tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Is she going to have an abortion?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I'm not sure but she better make up her mind soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Is Byron or Paco the dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Neither, she says it's some older guy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Damn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> And if I ever find out who it is, he's dead!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> You would think he would know how to use protection</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> She says it was the &quot;heat of the moment&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Sounds like the path my mom took once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Kissing his neck) Well, I'm glad she did for purely selfish reasons</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy tries not to smile.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Hey, I almost forgot, there's a poetry festival in Santa Cruz this weekend, let's go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Can't, I've got to work a double shift</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> At the butcher shop? - just bail!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I need the money</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I need YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> It's for the rent, mom's boss screwed her over again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Opening her purse) How much?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> PEN, NO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> HOW MUCH?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I can't keep taking your money!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Look, I want you by my side, I hardly get to see you as it is - this festival is important, Jere</p>

<div class="stage">Rubbing his face with his hands, Jeremy thinks for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Forget useless school, forget your slave jobs, life is meant to be lived... every beat of your heart is like a ticking clock and you never know when the alarm is going to go off</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Looking at his watch) Speaking of time, I need to take my brother to the skate park, he's learning the Varial today</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Please think about the festival, please?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Grabbing his board and kissing her goodbye) I will, I promise</p>

<div class="stage">Moments after Jeremy leaves, Penelope hears a tapping at her bedroom window. She deliberately ignores it. A few seconds later, it slides open and Brad Martel enters the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Not looking at him) Don't snakes usually crawl in through the toilet?</p>

<img  src="assets/images/v04_brad.jpg" h="509" w="320"  b="0" a="center">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Going over to her) Is that any way to greet your uncle?</p>

<div class="stage">Still ignoring him, she holds up a middle finger to his face. He sucks it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Disgusted) Excuse me while I go disinfect my hand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Pulling at her arm) No time, let's go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Go where?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> C'mon, I have something to show you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> That line is as old as my grandparents</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I'm serious, do you have anything better to do?</p>

<div class="stage">Penny thinks for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Except maybe watch your gigolo boy toy at the skate park</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Sighing) How long will this take?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Evil grin) Not long - let's go, the truck is still running</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Fine - but we listen to MY music on the way, none of your Southern Fried Rock shit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Extending his arm) Deal</p>

<div class="stage">She pushes his arm away, grabs her purse, a few CDs and starts to climb out the window.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> We could just go out the front door</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Still climbing out the window) Yeah, we could</p>

<div class="stage">The youngest Martel brother chuckles and follows Penny out the window. They take off in his truck and drive into the south side of Santa Conchita. After heading down a block of dilapidated commercial buildings and a pothole-covered street, they finally pull up to an abandoned storefront.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Is this where you're going to rape, torture and kill me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Not this time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Heh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Winking) Don't look so disappointed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Raising her eyebrow) This place is a little small for a rave</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I agree</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Then, what's it for?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Getting out of the car) Something else</p>

<img  src="assets/images/v04_buildings.jpg" h="386" w="620"  b="0">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Reluctantly following) That's specific</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> No, that's the name - &quot;Something Else&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">The two walk inside the dark, dirty property.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I'm still not getting it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Stopping and turning around) I'm getting it... for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Happy Birthday, Merry Christmas, Super Solstice, whatever!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trying not to look impressed) Is there a shortage of flowers and candy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Half smile) Like you're a flowers and candy type of girl</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> And what exactly am I supposed to do here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I was thinking we could turn it into some kind of eclectic shop, a hangout - you could showcase your writing, maybe even your fey boy's drawings</p>

<div class="stage">Walking around the room, Penny smiles to herself as she considers what Brad is saying.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Now standing next to her) We can even throw in a tattoo and piercing parlor... I'd love to help you ring your nipples</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Sorry, my nose was painful enough - and where are you going to get the money for this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Shrugging) You know me, I have means</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Does that mean you are no longer living with your mom?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Clearing his throat) I have some investors lined up... speaking of which, it's time to go</p>

<div class="stage">As Brad starts for the door, a surprised Penny grabs his arm.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> WAIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Folding her arms and stepping back) Aren't... aren't you going to try anything?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Sorry, Sweetie, I have a date tonight with a lovely manicurist by the name of Amethyst Hill</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Sounds like a bar of soap</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> She could supply the store with candles, crystals, and her joujou magic crap... what's the matter, are you jealous?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Turning away) No, I'm just overwhelmed by the stench of dead rats in the walls</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Heading for the door) I say we leave 'em, give this place some atmosphere - c'mon, let's go</p>

<div class="stage">Before he can reach the door, Brad is suddenly slapped on the ass by Penny.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> This is cool...thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Now, before she can reach the door, Penny is pulled into Brad's arms and is pushed up against the wall. She tries not to smile they kiss passionately.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Wrapping her legs around him) Is that your cane, old man?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Feeling her up) Is it time to meet your boyfriend at the skate park, little girl?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Feeling her panties starting to slide down) Gee, you might be late for your date with Lavender Lake</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I'm gonna take you right here!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trying to unzip his jeans) Mmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I knew you didn't regret what happened at the beach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Freezing up) No, I didn't regret the lifeguard stopping us in time... I don't want to end up pregnant like my friend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Dropping her down) Hold on, I have some condoms in my truck... or did I use them all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Heh, sounds like pregnancy would be the least of my concerns - I think it's time for you take me home and go on your date... Uncle Brad</p>

<div class="stage">The two look longingly at each other for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> You're probably right... let's go</p>
