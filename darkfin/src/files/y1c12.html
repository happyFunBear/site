<div class="stage">In her KCON office cube, &quot;Fingers&quot; Takanachi is furiously typing HTML code on her computer as the phone rings. She hits the speaker button and continues typing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Speak to me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy Colvin</span> Hey Grace, it's Jere</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="250" w="209" src="assets/images/gracie_headshot.gif" a="center"/>Gracie</span> Hey you, all recovered from Moonglow?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Getting there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Still typing) Heh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Am I on speaker phone? - I hate speaker phone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Grow up and deal, I need all eight fingers right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Updating your &quot;Sig 7&quot; site?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yep - I have some super duper new screen shots to upload</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> You should stop wasting your talent on that lame TV show and waste your time on something COOLER... like helping me layer in some fart sounds with my fireworks sample</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Listen, you laid down some seriously sick jungle tracks on your own - I want to use them in my next mix</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Excellent - when I come by to pay you for the rave gig, I'll bring them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Still typing) No payment necessary, I had fun AND I sold a bunch of my CDs - in fact, I owe you a commission for delivering such a receptive audience to my clutches</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Defensive) I am NOT a charity case, I don't need your money!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> WHOA, did I say you were a charity case? - don't confuse me with your rich girlfriend!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> That was low</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Sweetie, I see you as my collaborator, therefore, I will pay you as a collaborator - it's not charity, it's salary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I guess that works</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Are you going with Penny to the party tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I suppose I should, but I want to come by Techtonic later and watch you DJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You're not of age</p>

<div class="stage">There is silence for a few seconds.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Meet me in the alley at 10:20 and wear a jacket with a hood... Jere, JERE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> The trash truck outside is making some funky noises, I need to capture it - see you tonight!</p>

<div class="stage">As she clicks off the phone, the KCON station manager walks by, causing Gracie to quickly switch screens to a work-related matter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Nose to the grindstone, that's what I love to see, Takanachi!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (All smiles) ABSOLUTELY, MR. GATES</p>

<div class="stage">He walks away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Under her breath) It's better than my nose up Kylee's BLECH</p>

<div class="stage">After shaking off the repulsive thought, she returns to her HTML screen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Let's see, maybe this font would work better in a dark blue</p>

<div class="stage">The phone rings again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Hitting the speaker button) NOW WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Love you too, Fingers!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Eyes, do you have your parodies ready for the site?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'll e-mail them to you this afternoon, I promise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Doesn't believe him) Uh-huh</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="220" w="288" src="assets/images/y1c12_sigma_7.jpg"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I saw the new Sig 7 banner you did, I have to say, it's not working for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Well, when you become Adobe proficient, you can try it yourself - right now, you're the lowly writer, remember your place!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Yes, master - where's our sweet little newbie?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Morri is in the video library going through old footage - she's convinced the yahoos at the Coast Guard are sitting on a ton of info about our &quot;In Search Of... &quot; mystery</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I could've told her that!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You did</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Oh yeah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Anyway, she's familiarizing herself with the background and looking for leads, in between our challenging adventures of covering a flock of wild parakeets and the soaring cost of gas</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Things have been slightly on the tame side since the train wreck</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'll tell ya, if I don't get some excitement soon, I'm likely to drop dead of boredom</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan charges into Gracie's cube.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan McBride</span> SMELT INNARDS? - THAT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Here's our sweet little newbie, now!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Does he think I was born yesterday? - I might not be a marine biologist or even a fisherman but even I know those were NOT smelt innards</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> This conversation sounds disgusting, what's it about?</p>

<div class="stage">McBride reaches over and clicks off the speaker phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"><img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="147" w="216" src="assets/images/y1c12_phone.gif" a="center"/>Morrigan</span> I hate speaker phone</p>

<div class="stage">Almost instantly, Zach calls back and Gracie puts him on speaker again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Eyeing Morrigan) My phone, my cube, my RULE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Look, I need to take off for a little bit, I'll explain everything at the party tonight</p>

<div class="stage">As she turns to leave, Morrigan is blasted with cackles from both Gracie and Zach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You actually think we're going to the museum ball?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Aren't you?</p>

<div class="stage">The cackles resound louder.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Sorry, M&amp;M, we're not part of the Duquesa Bay upper crust</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Snooty voice) Tonight, we shall be bowling with Half and the Mirabello Twins</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Half?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> His name is really Hal but I call him Half since he's nothing more than a breathing sex toy to me, it's the half I use</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Put that in a Hallmark card!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> If Zach plays his cards right with Justine tonight, she might let us do some probing, literally and figuratively, with the Celoso Beach bodies</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I am so proud that my dating skills allow me to barter for corpses</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Great, I was counting on you guys to be there for me tonight - I won't know anyone there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I realize we're adorable and cuddly but take this as an opportunity to meet new playmates!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> That reminds me, Kylee and her Sugar Daddy will be there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Eww! - not exactly at the top of my list of cool people to hang with</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It will be tres enjoyable - you get to watch him parade around with his wife and you get to watch her jump everything that possesses a &quot;Y&quot; chromosome</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thrilling</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey, I bet R'xal will be there!</p>

<div class="stage">Takanachi pulls a mini digital camera out of her drawer and thrusts it into McBride's hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Get some pictures of her!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Perplexed look) Who or what is R'xal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Deep voice) R'XAL, QUEEN OF THE WARRIOR MOONS AND SWORN ENEMY OF THE SIGMA SEVEN COLONY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rolling her eyes) You two have too much time on your hands</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey, it beats peddling drugs in school parking lots... not that I'd know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Actually, R'xal is Ursula Dragovic aka Mrs. Douglas Martel II</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I remember Ursula on all of the covers of my fashion magazines as a teenager!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Deep voice again) Now she is R'XAL, QUEEN OF THE WARRIOR MOONS, PLAGUE OF KRAKIS PRIME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> On the subject of costumes, do you have one picked out?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, and it's driving KJ crazy because he doesn't know what it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Evil grin) Smart girl... string him along</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> So, what is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm going as &quot;Lois Lane&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> OH MY GOD, ARE YOU SERIOUS? - that is so lame, Honey, think of something else!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Deep voice continued) It would be better if you went as R'XAL, QUEEN OF THE WARRIOR MOONS, ALLY OF THE AMPHIBIAN...</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie clicks off the phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I can let you borrow my family kimono</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, there is nothing wrong with going as Lois Lane - I have my grandmother's beautiful wool suit from the 40's, I'll pull my hair back in a bun and put on my round, tortoiseshell glasses</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Ooh, sexy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It was a big hit with the office Halloween party back in Montana</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> The operative words being &quot;back in Montana&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hey, it's all I have - I'm still digging out of debt from moving, I do not have the money to rent a fancy costume NOR do I want KJ throwing his trust fund in my face</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Making a lewd gesture with her mouth) He is more than welcome to throw it in mine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking off) I need to get going, I'll call you later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Have fun with the faux smelt innards!</p>

<div class="stage">The field producer returns to the HTML.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (To herself) I never thought I'd utter those words together in a sentence</p>

<div class="stage">Inside the Renselier family home, Penelope sits outside of an alabaster tub and assists her 45-year-old mother, Lydia, with her bath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia Renselier</span> Did you change the blade in the razor, Darling? - it feels a little dull</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny Renselier</span> (Shaving the leg) Yes mom, but the razor can't deal with the fact that you're growing timber instead of hair</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> DAMN SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Did you take your morning meds today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I'm tired of taking pills, they don't work</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> But the doctor said...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Splashing about) DO YOU SEE THE DOCTOR HERE SHAVING MY LEGS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Please don't get upset, you have a big night ahead of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Observing her daughter's ensemble) At least you're always ready in the costume department</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Putting the razor down) Actually, I was considering going to the ball in &quot;normal&quot; clothes, just for a change</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Do you own any normal clothes?</p>

<div class="stage">Penny sits back and thinks for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> So, Penelope, do I dare ask where you were last night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Soaping up her mother's other leg) I was in the general vicinity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Having sex and doing drugs with that rowdy bunch of yours, no doubt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Oh, we do more than that - we discuss how the former Eastern Bloc countries are faring since the downfall of Communism, THEN we have sex and do drugs</p>

<div class="stage">Her mother glowers at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Half smile) And we dance, too</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> It's not funny, Dear, I worry about you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Don't worry - I hear they're training Golden Retrievers now to shave legs</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Infuriated) DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I WORRY ABOUT YOU?</p>

<div class="stage">The surprised girl pulls back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> DAMMIT, YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER, I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO YOU SINCE I CANNOT IMAGINE ANOTHER SOUL ON THIS PLANET THAT I WOULD GLADLY GIVE UP MY LIFE FOR IN A HEARTBEAT</p>

<div class="stage">The older woman struggles to sit forward in the tub to be closer to her daughter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (On the verge of tears) I know I won't stop you from doing what you want to do, but the very thought of something horrible happening to you makes me insane, can't you understand that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Hugging her mother) Shhhh, I do... I do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Leaning back in the tub) Good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trying to keep her composure) For... um, for your information, I just watch them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I'm supposed to take comfort in you being a voyeur?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY is that I'm still a virgin, believe it or not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Looking her daughter in the eye) I do believe you... why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Shaving the other leg) I'm just not ready yet - as for drugs, I've seen what doctor-prescribed chemicals do to you, why would I want to take illegal ones?</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y1c12_thebath.jpg" h="403" w="620"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Smiling) Despite the nose ring, you make me proud to be your mother</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Finishing up the leg) What can I say, my parents raised me right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Well, when the time IS right for you, I pray that it is with anyone other than that Jeremy boy - I don't like him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Throwing down the razor) You just HAD to ruin this moment - why don't you like him, because his mother is a sales clerk?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I believe that Byron is better suited for you, that's all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Scowling) Because he lives in the same gated community? - FYI, he's the one that does the most X at parties</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I should inform his parents!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Folding her arms) Sure, right after his mother comes down from her coke high and his dad drops the bottle of Porfidio</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Dear lord, I've had enough of this subject matter - and I've had enough of this bath - help me out, I'm getting all pruney!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Hoisting her mother under her arms) Why don't you paint yourself purple and go as a California Raisin tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Wrapping a towel around her) Lend me your sunglasses and I'll consider it</p>

<div class="stage">The Goth Chick watches her MS-afflicted mother struggle across the room with her arm crutches.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> You know, Aunt Steph said she'd be happy to come by and help out whenever you need it... why won't you take her up on it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I don't need anyone's help!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> And what am I doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Applying some lotion) You're my daughter, that's different</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Why don't you ask dad to help?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> He has important business matters to take care of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Coming over and helping with the lotion) Is that why he was out all night?</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia looks at her with a combination of surprise and quiet defeat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> The maid told me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> It's none of her business</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> It's my business</p>

<div class="stage">The two walk out of the bathroom and down the hall.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> There's nothing wrong with asking others for help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Yes, there is - the minute you do, they see you as weak</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Why aren't you afraid of me seeing you as weak?</p>

<div class="stage">Before she enters her bedroom, Mrs. Renselier turns to face Penelope.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Because I love you</p>

<div class="stage">At the Quartz County Museum, there is a mad rush of people getting ready for the &quot;Etruscan Nights&quot; Masquerade Ball. A man and a woman, dressed as caterers, enter one of the main rooms and spot a security guard. He looks around and nods to them. Within seconds, they blanket the room, stashing tiny electronic devices at various points. The security guard follows them as they enter another room and repeat the process.</div>

<div class="stage">Inside a well-kept condo overlooking Duquesa Bay, Timothy Hajanian reads the Daily Beacon as he sips a cup of coffee and smokes a cigarette. The sounds of smooth jazz are suddenly overwhelmed by loud pounding on his door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Timothy Hajanian</span> (Opening it) Yes?</p>

<div class="stage">The petite KCON reporter barges her way inside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan McBride</span> I need to talk to you, Mr. Hajanian</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Slamming the door shut) Come right in!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'M NOT STUPID</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Alright, we've established you're not stupid but I still don't know who the hell you are!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Morrigan McBride - I just came from the university - they said you were the one who did the testing on my sample</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Oh yeah, the smelt innards</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> SMELT INNARDS, MY ASS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> There is no need to be crude - why don't we sit down, relax, and try to have a civil exchange so we can figure out exactly what your problem is</p>

<div class="stage">The pony-tailed man leads Morrigan to an Italian leather sofa.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Would you like some coffee? - on second thought, that's probably not a good idea for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting in his face) Who are you protecting?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> WHOM</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm broadcast, not print</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Let's take this one step at a time... what is your issue with the test results?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My issue with the test results, Mr. Hajanian...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Please, call me Tim</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> TIM, is that they are 100% bogus!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> And you came to this conclusion how?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Because I know better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> That's scientific!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I thought Dr. Sanchez would be doing the test himself?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Angered) ARE YOU DOUBTING MY ABILITY?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, don't misunderstand me, I just assumed that Dr. Sanchez...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Jumping up and pacing) Look, Dr. Sanchez does not have time to run samples for some stranger off the street - my testing procedures are just as precise, if not more, than his - and the results, Ms. McBride, if you like them or not, are SMELT INNARDS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> BULL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Wrong species</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do you honestly expect me to believe that someone was cutting bait on my bumper at 2:00 in the morning?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Sitting down again) Now, you've totally lost me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Well, let's go on the premise that you really have no clue what I'm talking about</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> So far, so good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Did Dr. Sanchez hand my sample over to you himself?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Guilty expression) No, he did not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who did?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> It was waiting for me when I got in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who else had access to that sample?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> It could've been a number of people - department professors, even students</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Shaking her head) That's just wonderful, anyone could have doctored it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Ms. McBride... Morrigan, why don't you tell me what you THINK the test results should be and we'll work from there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not smelt innards</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="275" w="118" src="assets/images/y1c12_statue.gif" a="center"/>Tim</span> You're not helping</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Let's just say it will help me make a positive ID</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Fake excitement) Will it lead to the &quot;real killers&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">The two are interrupted by the phone. Tim's answering machine comes on and a man's voice speaks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man's Voice</span> Hello Timothy, I just wanted to say what great time I had last night - are you free this weekend?</p>

<div class="stage">A nervous Hajanian rushes over and turns it down as a smiling Morrigan rises and goes over to one of the many nude sculptures throughout the rooms.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Returning to her side) Where were we?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know who that was, I interviewed him yesterday for a piece - nice guy - married guy - prominent guy!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> YOU BITCH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I will do anything for my story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> What do you want?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have a backup sample...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Why am I not surprised?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Clear a time this weekend - we will go to the lab and I will WATCH as you redo the test - deal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> If I do this, will you promise not to use my friend as an eternal marker with me?</p>

<div class="stage">The woman lightly runs her fingers down a bronze male torso statue.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's an awfully big marker</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Getting in her face) It's an awfully big test</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Extending her hand) Deal</p>
