      <p>Penny Renselier and her friends awaken after a heavy night of partying. Enjoying breakfast with Amethyst, Morrigan eagerly awaits the test results while she considers a rack of expensive ball costumes from KJ. Sandy and Ona Rosa Sanchez start the morning off right but quickly get into a disagreement. Captain Phelps and Lieutenant Fiore deal with a broken door, pirate costumes and fun with an ironing board. Erika and KJ share the usual sibling strife. Mysterious plans are made for the museum ball. </p>

<div class="stage">In the woodlands near Quartz Lake, a group of teens and college kids are scattered around, some sleeping, some passed out, from the rave of the night before. Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; Renselier, dressed in black with a blood-red feather boa wrapped around her neck, is clustered under an olive army blanket with another girl and three guys. She wakes up to the sound of the funeral march playing on her beeper.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Uhh, fucking mosquitoes - where are my sunglasses?</p>

<div class="stage">Fumbling through her black rubber and rhinestone purse, she slips on her shades and finds the offending instrument while the others around her start to stir.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Reading the message) Dammit, mother!</p>

<div class="stage">She tries to wrestle her leather jacket away from the boy next to her and slowly starts to get up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Give me my jacket, Jere, I have to go home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Aww, c'mon Pen, you can stay a little longer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> No, I can't - I have to help my parents with their boring elitist party at the relic house tomorrow night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Brushing pine needles off of his Anime t-shirt) That could be fun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Looking for her car keys) Yeah, it could - but it won't - it's part of my punishment for staying out all night last weekend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Now standing beside her) At least you get to go home and help pick out what caviar to serve - I get to go home and wonder if we'll be having hot dogs or Spaghetti-O's for dinner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Throwing a 50-dollar bill at him) Take the whole family to Sizzler, knock yourselves out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I'm not taking your money!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Yes, you are - you always do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Pocketing it) True... but I just had to say that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Fixing her nose ring) Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">One of the boys gazes up at them from behind the blanket.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Byron</span> I'm dancing with the daisies, so orange and pretty - WAIT, it's Ghandi... and he's dunking doughnuts!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Looking at Jere) Can you handle them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> They'll be fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Walking off) Get Vesper home first - and if Byron or Paco lay one finger on her while she's out of it, they'll have to answer to me!</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy nods with a half smile.</div>


<div class="stage">Reapplying her black cherry lipstick, the Goth Chick trundles down a path to a junky-looking, funky sticker-covered, convertible, silver Jaguar and zooms off.</div>

<div class="stage">As the new day greets Willowbrook Avenue, Morrigan taps on the kitchen window of the main house while Amethyst and her cats have their breakfast. The woman with the blonde and lavender cornrows motions at her to come in.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Good morning</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Would you like something to eat? - we're having soymilk and rice flakes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking a seat at the table next to Roshumba) No thanks, I'm not that hungry - did anyone happen to call here for me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Slurping her drink) Nuh-mm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Damn him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Man troubles?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm just waiting for some test results</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Are you late?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO, not that kind of test result</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Does it have something to do with why you left so early this morning? - the roar of your engine interrupted the bliss of my sunrise yoga</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sorry, I just went to morning mass</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Mass? - isn't that supposed to be on a Sunday? - today's Friday</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><img   b="0" h="150" w="150" src="assets/images/y1c11_stones.gif" a="center">Morrigan</span> (Observing an intricate arrangement of stones on the table) I know, I just like to go in the mornings sometimes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Mouth full) You still believe in all of that stuff?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Some things I do, some things I don't - it's no better or worse than your rocks here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> They're RUNES and CRYSTALS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The church may be riddled with misogyny, hypocrisy, and megalomania but I still find a certain kind of peace there - it was the last place I felt totally secure with both of my parents</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Patting one of her cats) You know where I felt secure with my folks?</p>

<div class="stage">The petite brunette looks at her, awaiting an answer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Hmm... anyway, there was a delivery for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> A package?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Getting up) Sort of - follow me</p>

<div class="stage">The two go through a beaded doorway into Amy's living room where a rack of elaborate ball gowns stands in the corner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Eyes lighting up) Oh my God!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> All courtesy of KJ von Meer - he wants you to pick one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Feeling the velvet on one of the dresses) They're absolutely exquisite - look at the lacework on this Victorian one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I know, check out the headdress on this Venetian one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How can I possibly choose?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> It's certainly not your one-size-fits-all &quot;costume in a bag&quot; for Halloween - I have a friend in wardrobe at one of the movie studios and these dresses rent out for $500 a day or more</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you kidding me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Trying on the headdress) You're looking at a at least four months worth of rent on this rack</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Putting back the dress she was holding) I can't afford this!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> And people say I don't have all of my stars in a constellation - HE'S going to pay for it, silly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, he's not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Don't give me one of those independent woman speeches - KJ can buy a rack of small countries - trust me, he can afford your costume</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's not the point</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Of course not, the point is you're being proud... and stupid</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Look, even if we were going together for awhile, I'd still find this really uncomfortable - but for a first date, it's just not right - it sends out all of the wrong signals</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Eyes closed and holding her hands to hear head) Wait, I'm getting a signal - yes... it's very clear - YOU'RE A BLOODY LOON, PICK A DAMN DRESS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO - he can buy a dress but he can't buy me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Like you have something better to wear?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Walking off) As a matter of fact... I do</p>

<div class="stage">In a large, villa-style but unmistakably tract house in the hills of Chaparral Heights, Dr. Javier &quot;Sandy&quot; Sanchez quickly finishes making love to his wife, Ona Rosa.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Getting out of bed) I need to go, querida</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Husky voice) The kids don't have school today, why don't you stay home?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Putting on his robe) I have a 9:00 class</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Can't Tim cover for you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Stepping into the bathroom) They need to be PROPERLY prepped for their exam</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Sighing into her pillow) Then please come home at lunch so I can help Mama with your costume for tomorrow night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Starting to shave) Is that tomorrow night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Don't you dare back out of this, Javier!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Don't worry, I will do my best to be there, but I have a lot of important matters to take care of - the EPA has asked me to be their chief advisor to the team investigating the Santa Conchita River spill</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Somewhat disappointed) That's wonderful, honey - but I don't want to go to this event alone, I feel so out of place at these things</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I don't know, I just do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Coming out of the bathroom to give his wife a hug) Well, DON'T - you should have more self-confidence like your sister</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Self-confidence or arrogance?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Returning to the bathroom) Whatever it is, it works</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Sorry, I do not wish to portray the hot-blooded Latina stereotype Anita revels in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> It's better than being a mouse</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> ARE YOU SAYING I'M A MOUSE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You're twisting my words again</p>

<div class="stage">Ona Rosa falls silent as Sandy brushes his teeth with vigor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Spitting out the toothpaste) Besides, you'll have Erika and KJ there for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I want my husband there for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Retrieving the messages on his phone) DAMN, that girl won't leave me alone!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> What's wrong?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> The new KCON reporter, she keeps pestering me for test results - didn't even interview me and now she expects favors</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Maybe it's important</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Getting dressed) I'll check with Tim when I get in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I can expect you at lunch, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> I thought you were going out with Anita today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> She's coming by to take us to the beach and then we'll be going shopping for Uncle Hector's birthday present</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking at the clock) That sounds like fun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I can expect you at lunch, RIGHT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Kissing her on the cheek before he goes) Yes, yes - I promise</p>

<div class="stage">Outside of a second-story condo overlooking Duquesa Bay, Captain Craig Phelps arrives dressed as a Pirate of the Caribbean. He delivers four, firm bangs on a large, brass lion's head doorknocker. The sound of shrieking is suddenly heard inside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Startled) ANITA, ANITA ARE YOU ALRIGHT IN THERE?</p>

<div class="stage">The shrieking continues, causing him to break down the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Running inside) ANITA</p>

<div class="stage">He comes upon two naked women, precariously positioned on an ironing board. They all scream at the sight of each other.</div>

<div class="stage">The lieutenant stops what she was doing, struts into the kitchen, and grabs a towel as the other woman runs into the other room embarrassed.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Wiping herself) You are SO helping me fix that door!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I heard screaming</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> We will be attending the &quot;Etruscan Nights&quot; Charity Masquerade Ball tomorrow evening</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> HA, funny joke!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Lifting his eye patch) No joke!</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Is she one of the contestants?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> We will be attending in their place on behalf of the USCG - it's good community relations</p>

<div class="stage">The lieutenant smiles as the lithe redhead emerges from the other room, fully dressed.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I will be participating in some &quot;good community relations&quot; of my own tomorrow night, not to mention, I have a gig a Muldoon's</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Look, you like this PR bullshit, Crunch, I don't - you go!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I need a date</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> DON'T MAKE ME PULL RANK ON YOU, WE'RE GOING</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Scowling) He's such a piece of scum</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Getting a bowl of Cheerios) You know it, I know it, all of the Santa Conchita Valley knows it - BUT, Ona Rosa does not... and that's the problem</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Then, I will be proud to have TWO lovely Fiore women on my arm!</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Getting up) A 2.3 million dollar necklace on loan from the Barcelona Museum, solely for this event</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Whatever - where are you going?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> To get your costume out of my Jeep</p>
