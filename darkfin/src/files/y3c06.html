  <h1>Year 3, Chapter 6</h1><h2>The Other Sides</h2>

<div class="stage">Inside a darkened SCU laboratory, Erika is desperately 
 trying to find out more about the toxin that nearly killed her father. 
 Several experiments boil and bubble around her as she peers into a microscope.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> This is most definitely anemone based but there is a 
 secondary agent that I just cannot isolate... where have I seen this 
 before?</p>

<div class="stage">Unable to concentrate, the von Meer daughter takes a 
 step back from her work and dials out on the lab phone. She hangs up 
 after one ring and then redials the number.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Remember the code - one ring, followed by three...</p>

<div class="stage">Pacing between the adjoining Quartz Lake Inn suites, 
 Morrigan keeps one eye on Karl Sr. and another on a muted television 
 tuned to KCON. All of the window shades are drawn but enough natural 
 light creeps in to create eerie wall shadows. An already spooked McBride 
 switches on the bathroom light for peace of mind but her ringing cell 
 phone quickly shatters the mood. She counts the number of rings.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Hello?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> How are you doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Hi... better I guess - how are you doing?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika does not immediately respond.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I know, stupid question - I only asked because... 
 because you looked really sick when you left here</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c06_erika_morrigan.jpg" width="810" height="410"> </p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Don't worry about me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Someone has to</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Stephanie is helping out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I'm still working on the toxin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Any luck?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Luck isn't what I need right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> OK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Look, I apologize for being brusque, I'm rather tired 
 at the moment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Hey, I'm impressed that you even used the word brusque</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> How's my father?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Oh, right, your dad - he seems pretty much the same, 
 no drastic swings in his vitals</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Good - has he been lucid at all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> No, I haven't even seen him open his eyes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Is his temperature still at 101.6?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Checking something) Yep, it's been hovering around 
 that level for the last hour</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Is Big Joe still with you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> The front desk needed him - he's very freaked by 
 the whole thing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Aren't we all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> But I think he'll come through - he's bringing me 
 back something from the kitchen soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> When he does, please ask him for some ice - wrap it 
 in some towels and place it under my father's feet and hands - it should 
 help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I'll do that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Dr. Gates will check in on you two later tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What about you? - aren't you going to come over?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Once I find out what we're dealing with</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You will, I know it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Um, I should get back to work then - I'll see you later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Um... how's KJ doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I haven't seen him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Joe told me that he's trying to hold it all together</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> For the sake of the company, I hope he does</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Joe also told me that Ona Rosa was over at the house</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> And so were a lot of other people - you only need to 
 worry about yourself and my father right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Fine - but you can't stop me for worrying about you... 
 'bye</p>

<div class="stage">Erika hangs up the phone and strains against an oncoming 
 migraine. She returns to her experiments but can't help scratching an 
 irritated side of her neck. There is now blood under her nails.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Dammit, what is going on? - one problem at a time, please</p>

<div class="stage">Shelby Willis enters the lab and is not surprised to 
 find Erika there.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> Girl, there is no problem in this room that is more 
 important than being at home with your kin right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> What are you doing here, Shel? - I thought Calvin had 
 a t-ball game?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> He is with a sitter because I was at YOUR HOUSE and 
 that is exactly where you should be!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I will later - I need to finish this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> HORSE APPLES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Please, I can't get into this with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> Help me understand what is going on in that crazy blonde 
 head of yours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Maybe this is how I deal with loss?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> And maybe I'll sprout wings and become a ballerina</p>

<div class="stage">Erika crinkles her nose and unknowingly scratches at 
 her neck.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> (Noticing the red patch) Precious Miss, what in the 
 world is going on with your skin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Nerves</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> (Trying to get a closer look) It looks like something 
 the CDC needs to see</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Enough with the drama, Shelby, I've had more than enough 
 lately</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> It's more than just welts, those look like scales!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It's dry skin irritated by a rash caused from nerves 
 and you're not helping!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> Sorry child - I have some lotion in my bag but it looks 
 like you'll need more than a squirt or two</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> If you really... really want to help me, I could use 
 your advice on the slide under the electron microscope</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> (Taking a look) About time you asked for some assistance, 
 did it maim you to do so?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Let me know if you reach the same conclusions about 
 the levels</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> You know, I know you don't get along with Pauline but 
 your mother seriously needs you right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Checking some beakers) She has KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> She needs her daughter, more than ever - she not only 
 lost her husband but the father of her children</p>

<div class="stage">Erika does not comment. She continues to work on her 
 findings as Shelby does the same. Javier Sanchez rounds the corner and 
 is surprised to see both women at work. He ducks behind a door before 
 they see him and quietly observes the scene. Erika goes over to Shelby 
 to check her findings.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You can't isolate it either?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> Not yet but I know who would be the perfect person 
 to ask</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Nearly jumping out of her skin) Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> Sandy - yes, I saw him working on something like this 
 the other day</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> (Revealing himself) Ladies, did I hear my name mentioned?</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Back at the Quartz Lake Inn, Joe Tiszo is in the kitchen, 
 preparing a meal for Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joe</span> (Muttering under his breath) This is wrong, all wrong</p>

<div class="stage">His sous chef overhears.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Chef</span> Did you need more parsley?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joe</span> I have to stop this before it gets out of hand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Chef</span> Are you alright, Mr. T?</p>

<div class="stage">Joe suddenly leans against the sink and grabs his head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joe</span> NO - I REFUSE TO LISTEN</p>

<div class="stage">And with that, he rushes out of the kitchen. Back inside 
 her suite, Morrigan takes Karl Senior's temperature.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Crap, it's gone up to 102 - I wonder what's keeping 
 Joe?</p>

<div class="stage">She lets out a small shriek as the elder von Meer suddenly 
 grabs her wrist and squeezes it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Mr. von Meer?</p>

<div class="stage">Karl flutters his eyes until they fully open. He regards 
 the figure before him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl Sr.</span> (Weakly) Are... are you safe?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> We're both safe... for now - how are you feeling? 
 - is there anything I can get you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl Sr.</span> I'm so... so proud of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Uh, I'm not Erika... I'm Morrigan - your daughter 
 will be here later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl Sr.</span> I'm proud... of both of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl Sr.</span> There's... more to come... so much more</p>

<div class="stage">He slips back into unconsciousness.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Mr. von Meer? - Karl? - where in the hell are you, 
 Joe?</p>

<div class="stage">McBride scans the room for a minute and focuses on a 
 plastic bucket.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I need to get that ice!</p>

<div class="stage">Zipping up her jacket, Morrigan throws the hood over 
 her face and puts on a pair of dark glasses.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> It's only down the hall... it's only down the hall</p>

<div class="stage">With bucket and key card in hand, Morrigan carefully 
 peeks past the door to make sure no one is around. She dashes out and 
 hurries along the corridor to where she thought the ice machine would 
 be.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> DUH, it's on the floor BELOW this one - of course 
 - why must I always suck at numbers?</p>

<div class="stage">Ducking an on-coming maid's cart, Morrigan slowly and 
 carefully creeps down to the other level. Two guests wait for the elevator 
 causing McBride to wait for them. Moments later, she is safely at the 
 ice machine filling her bucket.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You would think a place like this could afford ice 
 in every freaking room</p>

<div class="stage">As she turns to leave, Morrigan can't help but feel she 
 is being watched.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (To herself) STOP IT, you are just being paranoid</p>

<div class="stage">Climbing the flight of stairs, Morrigan feels a presence 
 gaining on her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Filet O'Fish, is that you playing hide 'n seek?</p>

<div class="stage">There is no response. Morrigan pauses at the door to 
 her level and waits. A figure in a blue robe now comes up the stairs 
 towards her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> NOT YOU CREEPS AGAIN</p>

<div class="stage">With all her might, the petite woman hurls the bucket 
 of ice at the figure and tries to fly out the door. It is now mysteriously 
 locked. The hood steps over the bucket and comes right up to Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Holding her key card up for defense) WHAT DO YOU 
 WANT FROM ME?</p>

<div class="stage">The figure pulls the hood back to reveal itself.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> AMY?
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c06_amy.jpg" width="458" height="410"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> They have him</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Outside the PCOC board meeting, an astounded KJ stares 
 blankly at the wall as Griffin and the other members pass by. Several 
 people offer condolences to the von Meer son and then head off in another 
 direction.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> That went much better than I had expected... so, what 
 are your thoughts, Kage?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I think I need a beer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> This is a moment of glory - it should be toasted with 
 a bottle of the best champagne</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I'm still trying to grasp what we are celebrating</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> It will make more sense when you study the files and 
 I expect you to stay late and do so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Man, I need to go home... be with my family</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> THIS is how you can be there for them - right now, 
 we're on schedule and everything is going smoothly for once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> My father just died and now you're talking about some magic 
 mystery metal that's going to revolutionize the world?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> It's going to turn the almighty oil cartels into yesterday's 
 news</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Do we need to destroy a mountain rage and the bay floor 
 to get to it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> A hill here, some fish there - in the overall scheme 
 of things, it's called progress</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Rubbing his head) I really need that beer</p>

<div class="stage">Observing from the conference room, Judge Victoria Martel 
 ambles over to her brother and KJ.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> Don't forget, Grif, father expected you to call him 
 as soon as the meeting finished</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> (Scowling) Yes, I am aware of that... I'll be right 
 back</p>

<div class="stage">The middle Martel brother rushes off as Victoria smirks 
 and gives KJ a large hug.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> How are you doing, junior?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I'm trying to find the words right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> I'm so sorry about Karl</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> Need a beer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Oh yeah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> Let's go get one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> First, could you please explain to me how and when all 
 of this happened and how we... how you got caught up in it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> We'll need more than one beer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I mean, you of all people, Vic - you're as tough as my 
 sister when it comes to the environment, I certainly did not expect 
 to find you at this meeting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> (Looking down the hall) Believe me, this is the last 
 place I want to be</p>

<div class="stage">She nods for him to come closer to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> (Barely above a whisper) Do you remember the Duquesa 
 Bay legends? - and I'm not just talking about the romantic one involving 
 the beheaded monk and his royal mistress...
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c06_victoria.jpg" width="483" height="410"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Sort of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> Well then, forget Griffin's files for now - I highly 
 recommend you go back and reread the history of this area</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Don't you think I have enough to do besides chase after 
 fables?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> Keep an open mind</p>

<div class="stage">A distraught KJ leans back against the wall and inhales 
 deeply. Victoria takes his hand and gently pats it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> I honestly did not want you to get tangled up in 
 this greedy web of havoc - I didn't want my brother or Meeramar or our 
 families involved... but we no longer have a choice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> What do you mean we don't have a choice? - we always have 
 a choice!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> Not this time, KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> That's bullshit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> Listen, my preferred piece of advice to you is to 
 run... to run as far and as fast as you can get - believe me, I tried, 
 but I also know what's coming and there's no way to get away from it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Jesus, Vic, you're making it sound like the freaking Death 
 Star is upon us - sorry, Yoda, I need to go home to my family and crack 
 open a cold one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> And that's exactly why I stayed in this - to protect 
 MY family</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> From what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Victoria</span> With your father gone, you need to sprout a large 
 hairy pair of your own - watch your back, watch your mother's back - 
 and especially... your sister's!</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">At the von Meer estate, Lydia and Penny Renselier are 
 the only ones remaining to keep Pauline company. Dr. Stephanie Gates 
 drops by to check up on things.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Pauline</span> (Clutching a bible) Thank you for being here, Liddie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> (Clutching her crutch) I flew back the minute I heard 
 what happened</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> (Under her breath) Not because your own daughter was 
 nearly killed in an earthquake</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> I'm sorry, sweetie?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Nothing... can I get you some water, Mrs. von Meer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Pauline</span> Thank you, Penelope, it's nice to know I can count 
 on you when I can't even count on my own children</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> (Getting up) Yeah</p>

<div class="stage">Penny traipses down to the kitchen where she finds Dr. 
 Stephanie sniffing at a plate of cold cuts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> You'd get a better high off of a Sharpie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Oh, Penelope - you startled me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Sorry, I had to come down for some water... and some 
 air</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> You don't... you don't do that with pens, do you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Relax, doc - I learned my lesson eating paste as a child</p>

<div class="stage">Stephanie stares at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> That was a joke</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> This is not really the time for jokes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Maybe it is - I know the biggest joke of all is going 
 on upstairs with Rikka's ma humping her bible like it's going to bring 
 back her dead husband or something
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c06_penny.jpg" width="365" height="367"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Maybe it brings her comfort</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Like when was the last time she was in a church? - when 
 was the last time she did something for someone else that wasn't self-serving?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> That's not the point</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Of course not, hypocrisy never is!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Are we talking about Erika's mom... or yours?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Heh, might as well throw them all in the same pool... 
 of course, we'd have to put floaties on my mother, first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Such a cynical young girl</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> I like &quot;jaded realist hottie&quot; better - when 
 a big scary problem comes along, I don't go running back to childhood, 
 desperately clinging to myths to solve my problems for me because I'm 
 too stupid to think for myself - for Pauline, it's the New Testament, 
 for my mom, it's Cinderella... what's your pick, Auntie Steph?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> I don't have a pick</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> See? - you're a woman of science, you know better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Science doesn't solve everything</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> It solves enough</p>

<div class="stage">Penny goes to grab something out of the refrigerator 
 and hums to herself as she does.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> (Thinking out loud) You have his exact same habit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Oh... um, a man I know does the same thing - hums 
 to himself when he's upset</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> What makes you think I'm upset?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> A mother can always tell</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> (Snapping open a bottle of water) Heh, that's not what 
 Brad told me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> It means we have some issues with our so-called families</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Young lady, you are very fortunate compared to a 
 lot of other girls your age who are simply struggling to survive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> I know, believe me, I know - I feel the pain of the 
 universe the very second I open my eyes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> No, Penelope, you know the pain of your sheltered 
 existence being challenged by unfair circumstances</p>

<div class="stage">Penny raises an eyebrow at the woman who does the exact 
 same back at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> I am sorry about your mother's condition and I know 
 the situation with your father is less than ideal but they are here 
 for you and they both love you dearly... surely even you can see that?</p>

<div class="stage">The goth girl thinks for a moment. Lydia comes to the 
 head of the staircase and looks down towards the kitchen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> Penelope?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Yo, what up?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> Stop talking like you're black, you weren't raised in 
 a ghetto - are you bringing the water or not?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> It's on the way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> Please hurry, Pauline is parched</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Ooh, alliteration</p>

<div class="stage">Stephanie and Penelope watch Lydia struggle back to Pauline's 
 room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Be careful where you're walking, mom!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Lydia</span> Yes, dear</p>

<div class="stage">Penny turns to go upstairs but pauses.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> (Looking back at Stephanie) You know, the absolute best 
 and worst day of my life is yet to come - when mom finally dies, it 
 will be a huge burden lifted off of my shoulders...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> But?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> But I don't want her to leave me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Your mother's love will always be with you, no matter 
 what</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> Maybe I don't want to leave her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> It's a natural part of life... to leave</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Penny</span> (Lumbering up the stairs with the water) Yep, so I've 
 noticed</p>

<div class="stage">Deep inside a cave, Amethyst leads Morrigan to where 
 the Clergy are holding their captive.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Whispering) You haven't said two words since we 
 left the inn, are you going to explain to me what's going on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> I can't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Try</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> I don't have enough time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> My foot is starting to hurt again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> That's to be expected</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Why are you dressed like one of them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> Shh... we're almost there</p>

<div class="stage">They come upon a chamber of stalactites and stalagmites. 
 In the middle of the polished floor lies a bound and blindfolded man 
 guarded by a cluster brown hoods.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Shocked) Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> (Struggling against the ropes) C'mon, people, no one 
 told me what the safe word was - I'm all for a few rope tricks, I even 
 got some cowboy chaps in the closet but this is ridiculous - my circulation 
 is cutting off!

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Apparently, not to his mouth</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan goes in for a closer look as the white robed 
 leader enters the cavern.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Great, it's that supreme jerkoff again - so, what's 
 your plan besides trading me in for Eyes?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan turns around to nothing. The sound of her own 
 breath fills the air.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Amy... Amy?</p>
