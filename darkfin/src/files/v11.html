<div class="stage">Adjacent to The Santa Conchita Plaza, the main department store mall and general meeting place, is X-rad, an arcade/laser
    tag center. Jeremy Colvin is hanging with his buddies, Paco and Byron, inside.
</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Tagging one of the opponents) Got him, there's only one standing!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> HA - HE'S MINE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> NOT UNLESS I NAIL HIM, FIRST</p>

<div class="stage">The last opponent is taken down and the victorious threesome celebrates with sodas in the food court.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> That was above and beyond!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> (Pulling up a chair) Our winning streak... STACKED AND INTACT</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> (Dancing around) We should be doing this every fucking day, man, this fucking 'burb is so fucking boring!</p>

<div class="stage">Two elderly ladies scowl at them in disgust.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> Whatcha peepin' at Grannie?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Give the elders their props, By</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> (Folding his hands in prayer) Ooh, Saint Jeremy</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> Hey, a tournament is throwing down here next month, shall we get in on it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> How much?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> $150 to enter - I figure we each pay $50?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> Master Math Man!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Can't, that's way out of my range - you'll have to leash up a new hound</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> AW, DUDE, COME ON</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> I can spot you for half</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Thanks, Paco, but I'm already your slave for the movies</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> (Waving his hand) Nah, don't sweat it - my treat</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> You can't keep bailing me out, bud</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> Look, I have my motivo ulterioso, Jere</p>

<div class="stage">Byron makes kissing noises and flicks out his tongue.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> (Bopping him on the arm) SHUT IT, ASSWIPE</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> (Taunting voice) MAKE ME</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> GUYS, KEEP THIS UP AND THEY'LL BE HAULING US OUT THE DOOR</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> BRING 'EM</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> Listen, Colvin, before someone decided to trash the moment with his latent homo fantasies, I was about to
    say that we seriously need you as our wingman for this tourney... DEAD SERIOUS, that's why I'll stand up for your half
    and By will tackle the other</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> REALLY? - and when exactly did I shake on this?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> (Kicking him under the table) That's funny, I thought I just heard you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> (Sighing) I suppose - what's another $50? - besides a few disco biscuits or some cheap weed</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Thanks, you two, but I still need to toss it a bit</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> What exactly do you need to think about? - if we all-time score, we get TWO LARGE... that's $666.00 split
    between us</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> 666, man, that's too real!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> SHIT, I TOTALLY BLANKED</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> What?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Holding his head) I promised Renfro I'd do a new Satan stencil on his board, I was supposed be there
    yesterday
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> So? - just show up there now</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Can't, he already fled for the weekend - damn, that was going to be extra quick cash in my pocket!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> DUDE, WHAT IS WITH CRYING POVERTY ALL THE FUCKING TIME?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Grabbing him by the shirt) Because I AM fucking poor - I don't have my parents' trust fund to thrive
    off of - I have to WORK... TWO JOBS</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> THAT'S YOUR FUCKING MOTHER'S DEAL, NOT YOURS</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> YOU MENTION MY MOM AGAIN AND I'LL TOAST YOU</p>

<div class="stage">Paco gets between the two of them.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> COOL IT, BROS</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> (Still glaring at Jere) Look, I'm sorry you have a deadbeat dad but his woman and their spawn are NOT YOUR
    RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> IF I DON'T STEP UP, WHO WILL?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> Why don't you ride Penny the Cash Cow? - she's sure as hell not giving you any other kind of ride</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> FUCK YOU, BY</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> But he speaks the word</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I am NOT taking money from my girl - that is SUPER WEAK</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> NO, dude, it's called &quot;EQUALITY&quot; - see the total look I'm sporting? - I didn't have to purchase
    a single thing, even the kicks - all offerings from desperate girlies trying to hook up with me</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> (Slapping Paco on the back) Excellent!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I cannot do that</p>

<div class="stage">Penelope Renselier strides up in back of Jeremy and wraps her arms around him.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> OK, Jere, time to say bye-bye to your loser boys and spend time with me!</p>

<div class="stage">The two share a kiss as Paco and Bryon share a smug glance.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Getting up) I ain't turning that down!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Paco</span> Deeply ponder the tournament, Jere, and call me later</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Byron</span> And don't forget to PICK UP some new threads while you're here</p>

<div class="stage">The young man scowls back at his two buddies and takes off with his girlfriend.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> You have some time before work, don't you?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Looking at his watch) Yeah, about a half hour</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Snuggling against him) Good... what were those two dickheads crying about?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Nothing special</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> Are you entering a tournament?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> They think so - I'll probably be too busy helping out Grace with some new tracks</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> Heh, you'd rather spend time with Gracie than me?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> It's the ONE indentured servitude that I enjoy</p>

</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Joking) I thought you LIKED the fuzzy studded collar I gave you?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Smiling) My brother put it on the dog</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> I bet your mom was thrilled</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> She didn't even notice</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> So what's up with Byron's fashion advice? - need some new clothes?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Defensive) NO</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Dragging him) C'mon - I'll get you this vintage PiL shirt I saw in...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> NO, PEN... thank you</p>

<div class="stage">Penelope folds her arms and walks ahead.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> How's your mom doing?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> About the same - although bladder control is becoming an issue</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Huh, I was going to ask you if you wanted some lemonade?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> That's gross, Jere</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I'm serious, if you want something to eat, I can get it for you - I'm getting paid at the butcher shop
    tonight</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> I already had lunch with my dad, thanks</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Still snooping through his e-mail?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> I have to - it's the only way to keep tabs on him... and &quot;Timmy&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Sighing) Don't you ever wish you could trade in our parents?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> All the freaking time - but then I start to think... and no, I wouldn't</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> You're right - although I would only keep my mom - my dad definitely needs to drop off the earth... WAIT,
    HE ALREADY HAS</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> Still nothing from him?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Zilch - he's too busy jumping from one oil rig to the next</p>

<div class="stage">As people pass by and stare at Penny's appearance, Jeremy takes her hand and strides alongside.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Under her breath) Humans... I wish they would all spontaneously combust sometimes</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Well, we don't exactly blend in... you can't really fault them</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> Can't I? - I could care less what they think about me - I just hate it when they stare at my mom when we're
    out in public</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> They don't know any better - the biggest crisis most of them have to deal with is a hangnail or a clashing
    sofa pattern</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> I think she reminds them of their own mortality and they don't have the spine to deal</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Not everyone is blessed with a spine of steel like yours</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Rubbing his arm) You appreciate my spine of steel?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I think it's sexy as hell - and I'm pretty sure there's a fetish group out there who would agree with
    me
</p>

<div class="stage">The two chuckle and continue to stroll through the mall.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> After work, you want to meet me at the cemetery later?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Hesitant) I can't... I have this project I'm working on</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Shocked) For school?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> No, not really</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> What's it for?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> I can't really say yet - but when it's ready, you'll be so surprised!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Suspicious) Surprises are not really my thing</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> I think you'll like this one</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Stopping her) Does it have anything to do with why that pig ass Brad keeps following you around?</p>

<div class="stage">Penny looks away.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> IT DOES</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> Do you trust me, Jere?</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy tries to subdue his anger.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> DO YOU?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Yeah</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Penny</span> GOOD - because if everything goes according to plan, it will be the answer to all of our prayers!</p>

<div class="stage">Penelope kisses Jere on the cheek and runs down the &quot;up&quot; escalator, daring him to follow in her footsteps.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Under his breath) Prayers or spells?</p>
