  <h1>Year 1, Chapter 4</h1><h2>&quot;Thinly Sliced&quot;</h2>
 
<div class="stage">Earlier that evening... </div>

<div class="stage">Inside the Santa Conchita University lab, Erika von Meer is asleep, slumped over her papers and books. Griffin Martel, styling in a charcoal gray Armani suit, enters and softly approaches the woman.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><img border="0" height="237" width="192" src="../assets/images/griffin_headshot.gif" alt="Griffin Martel (art by Dale McKee, 2000)" align="right">Griffin Martel</span> (Patting her shoulder and whispering loudly) Rikka... Rikki... Rikki Tikki Tavi, wake up!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Groggy and groaning) Riff... what are you doing here?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (All cheerful) We have a dinner date, remember?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Uh</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika slowly rises and looks at her disheveled appearance in a mirror.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> EEH</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You look wonderful</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Fixing her hair) Liar</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes, but I'm good at it</p>
 
<div class="stage">This elicits a small chuckle from the woman.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I thought you had polo practice?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I did... it's over</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking at her dive watch) Whoa, I slept longer than I thought... OH NO</p>
 
<div class="stage">Reaching into Griffin's vest pocket, she grabs his cell phone and calls home.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Father, I'm so sorry, I'll be home shortly and we'll work on the business then, I promise!</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika hands the phone back to Griffin, lifts her glasses and rubs her eyes.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Work can wait, we've got a dinner to eat</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Actually, that sounds pretty good</p>
 
<div class="stage">Griffin's cell phone goes off.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Hello? - how's everything going? - EXCELLENT - you have a wonderful evening, I know I'm going to enjoy mine... goodbye!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Heading for the exit) I feel like fish</p>
 
<div class="stage">With his hands folded behind his back, Griffin follows.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Well, my enjoyment level just dropped a notch</p>
 
<bar></bar>
 
  
<div class="stage">At the Samurai Sushi Bar, overlooking beautiful Duquesa Bay, the stately blonde pounds down tuna and salmon sashimi as the swarthy gentleman in her company picks at his marinated octopus.</div>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Watching Erika voraciously eat two more slices) Rikka, darling, even though I have no idea why you like this little hole in the wall, we're still in public... must you eat like a pig?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><img border="0" height="192" width="200" src="../assets/images/sushi.gif" align="right" alt="Sushi">Erika</span> (Dipping another slice in wasabi) Suddenly, I hear my mother's echo in here</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Well, if Pauline WERE here, she would be correct in making that statement</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> &quot;Must you eat like a pig?&quot; is an interrogative, not a statement</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Joshing) And I invited you to dinner again... why?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Good question!</p>
 
<div class="stage">The two laugh and regard each other for a moment.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I apologize if my dining habits are a little extreme tonight, this is the first time in days I've had a real appetite</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You need to take better care of yourself</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Mmm-hmm</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Where were you last night? - and don't say &quot;at the lab&quot; because you weren't</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Drinking some saki) Are you stalking me, Riff?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I'm just curious... you weren't at your family's, you weren't at the lab, you weren't on your boat... where were you?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> If you must know, I was at the research facility on Concha Dos - am I free to go now, Officer Martel?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Leering) Maybe I need to handcuff you to the bed</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika stares at him blankly.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Sorry... but you are spending too much time at work</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You know, I just had this conversation with my mother and brother this morning, I really don't feel like repeating it</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Now popping a California Roll in his mouth) I'm just concerned, that's all</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> How was polo practice today?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Lacking, as usual</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Really?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking at his Rolex) I know Craig had more important matters to take care of but we absolutely have to find a better replacement for him</p>
 <p><img border="0" height="248" width="235" src="../assets/images/erika_headshot_new.gif" align="right"><b>Erika</b>: What's wrong with Shelby?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> She T-boned your brother in the third chukker!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Knowing KJ, he probably liked it</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Ms. Willis is not quite up to our standard of excellence</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Miffed) Because she's a woman or because she's black?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> This has nothing to do with her gender or her race... </p>
 
<div class="stage">Griffin reaches under the table and squeezes Erika's knee.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Evil smirk) She's just not the player you are</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika casually flicks the man's hand off of her knee.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking at a TV in the corner of the bar) It's almost time for Craig &amp; Anita's Dog &amp; Pony Show</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Which one is the dog and which one is the pony?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I think they both tie for &quot;horse's ass&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Before that starts, just a small reminder that you and I will be attending Aunt Liddy's &quot;Etruscan Nights&quot; museum gala next week</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Is that so?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes, we will!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Lydia has worked very hard on this, I suppose I could go</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Penelope flat-out refuses to go unless you're there to suffer along with her</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Picking something out of her teeth) Heh</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Curt) Hopefully, you will have regained your manners by then</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> When did Sybil arrive at the table?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking at his watch again) I don't understand your reference</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Only a little bit ago, you're dragging me to dinner, now you're acting like you want to be anywhere else BUT here</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Don't be ridiculous</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Shh... it's time for the press conference</p>
 
<div class="stage">Everyone strains to listen to the TV as sirens are heard in the distance.</div>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> (From TV) Good evening everyone, I'm Claudia Steel at the NewsCenter8 news desk, we're just receiving word of a breaking story - only moments ago, an east-bound freight train derailed past Riverbank Drive and the 101 intersection - there's no word yet on fatalities but we do know that several of its cars are on fire and some are apparently leaking oil into the Santa Conchita River - KCON has a news crew en route to the scene, we'll have more details for you shortly... </p>

<p><img border="0" height="60" width="163" src="../assets/images/kcon_logo_small.gif" align="left" alt="KCON NewsCenter 8"></p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Jumping up from the table) I've got to go</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Don't let this ruin our dinner</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> THERE'S OIL LEAKING INTO THE RIVER, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT HITS THE BAY</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> What can you do? - you're not a fireman</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rushing out the door) I'm going to the university, we'll need to set up a task force - YOU NEED TO GET TO THE OFFICE</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Rushing after her) Whatever for?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Whipping around in a fury) You know damn well that Meer-A-Mar cargo was probably on that train!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> So what if it was? - our fathers can handle it</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking him directly in the eye) If you EVER hope to grow out of your Daddy Dougie's shadow at this company, YOU WILL HANDLE IT, Griffin</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika stares at the man as he realizes the truth in what she says.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Getting in his limo) Can I at least drop you off?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sprinting off) It's just around the corner, I can make it faster on foot</p>
 
<div class="stage">Running between buildings and down alleys, the woman heads as fast as she can towards the beach. Suddenly, she doubles over in exhaustion.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (To herself) Changing twice in a 24 hour period... </p>
 
<div class="stage">Taking a few deep breaths, she sets her watch and puts it in her purse.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I suppose now is a good time to find out if I can handle it</p>
 
<div class="stage">Making sure no one sees her, Erika hurries along a jetty, strips off her clothes and dives into the ocean.</div>
