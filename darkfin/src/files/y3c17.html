<div class="stage">Thunder. Lightning. Rain. All ferociously blast the Meeramar tanker. Winds ripple the large poster of Karl von Meer, finally shredding it in half. With everyone scrambling for cover, KJ helps Erika to her feet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> You okay, sis?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Something hit us...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Yeah, a freak storm no one warned us about</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> No &mdash; from underneath</p>

<div class="stage">Panic breaks out amongst the mourners as large waves crash over the sides. Sensing danger, Craig does his best to control the situation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> EVERYONE, STAY CALM &mdash; PLEASE FOLLOW THE CREW BELOW &mdash; THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM</p>

<div class="stage">A sobbing and shaking Ursula Martel clutches Craig by the arm and hugs him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Craigie, this is not good &mdash; this is worse than any special effect mishap I've been through &mdash; please get us out of here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Trying to remain professional) Help is on the way, Mrs. Martel - please keep cool and remain with the others</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Stomping off) SCREW YOU</p>

<div class="stage">No one is listening to Craig. Hundreds of screaming people try to jam the narrow passageway. The governor and a few dignitaries try to muscle ahead of everyone. Craig pushes him back.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y3c17_craig_incharge.jpg" alt="" h="510" w="510"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Women and children first &mdash; unless you're a girly man</p>

<div class="stage">The governor reluctantly lets the others pass as Ben and Claudia pull their son and daughter by the arms.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> (To Ben) You and your bright idea of bringing the children to a funeral</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> But they wanted to come on the ship &mdash; and I didn't want to shield them from death</p>

<div class="stage">A towering wave crashes overhead and rocks the entire vessel.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Well, you're doing a damn good job!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> Mother</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Not now, just keep moving</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> But mother...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> For Christ's sake, Kayla, can't you see the trouble we're in?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> Where's Hannah?</p>

<div class="stage">The ship's first officer hurries by the dumbstruck family and catches up to Craig.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Officer</span> (Discreetly) There isn't enough room for everyone below deck &mdash; some will have to stay up here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Wiping the water off of his face) Are you out of your mind? &mdash; if those waves get any higher, we're going to be swept away like ants</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Officer</span> I'm afraid that's not the worst of it... there's a gash below the bow, we're taking on heavy water</p>

<div class="stage">Craig's face drops.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Officer</span> How long before your Coast Guard boys get here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> In these conditions... 15 &mdash; 18 minutes tops</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Officer</span> (Biting his lip) We're lucky if we have four</p>

<div class="stage">Stepping out of her minivan and into torrential rains, Ona Rosa rushes across the Our Lady of Guadalupe parking lot and into the church. Inside, she briskly wipes her face with a tissue and then promptly dips her fingers into a holy water font before making the sign of the cross.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Amen</p>

<div class="stage">Alone and in silence, Javier's wife makes her way to a statue of the Virgin Mary and kneels before it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Lighting a candle) Forgive me, Blessed Mother, for this is the only place I feel safe &mdash; the only place I can think freely</p>

<div class="stage">The lightning flashes intensify the already brilliant colors of the stained glass. The echoes of thunder boom through the empty pews.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I cannot go with this to my family... my husband</p>

<div class="stage">The winds howl through the trees and the roof.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I beg your forgiveness for such dark thoughts and darker actions...</p>

<div class="stage">As Ona Rosa takes out her rosary beads and begins to pray, she does not notice the side door open. A gust of wind extinguishes her candle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> 'til the hour of our death... amen</p>

<div class="stage">Footsteps approach her from behind. The sound causes Ona Rosa to drop the beads and jump up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Turning around) Is someone there?</p>

<div class="stage">Mrs. Sanchez scans all around. Nothing. She creeps down the aisle and takes a seat in the back row. Certain she is once again alone, Ona Rosa collects her thoughts and starts to pray.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Our Father...</p>

<div class="stage">Cold air creeps across her feet. Vapors of frosty breath hover over her shoulder.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Voice</span> Sed libera nos a malo...</p>

<div class="stage">Before Ona Rosa can respond, her rosary beads slip around her neck and tighten.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">At the Fiore farmhouse, Carmen is in the kitchen preparing dinner. She pauses for a moment and heads for the family room. She removes a loose brick from the fireplace and takes out a small, ornate wooden box.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Oh mija, I do not know if you are ready to handle this...</p>

<div class="stage">She slowly opens the box and sighs. Anita's bracelet continues to glow.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Carmie!</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen quickly shuts the box and stashes it just as Frank and Hector walk in the back door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> I can smell the tamales down the road, let's eat!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Shh &mdash; nietos!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Taking off his jacket) The grandkids are here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> They're taking a nap before dinner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Where's my Rosa?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> At church, she's saying a rosary for KJ's father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> That's right &mdash; Stephi mentioned the... service was today</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Ay, Stephie? &mdash; please, Hector, tell me you are not involved with that bruja again?</p>

<div class="stage">Hector says nothing and heads for the kitchen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Following him) Are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Following her) Wait a minute &mdash; why wasn't my daughter invited to pay her respects in person? &mdash; she's a close colleague of von Meer...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Opening the refrigerator) Cerveza, Francis?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Angry) How dare they think Ona Rosa is not good enough to attend their fancy functions!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> It's a funeral for crying out loud!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Both of you, lower your voice</p>

<div class="stage">Frank slams his cane down on the kitchen table and takes a seat. Hector deposits a beer in front of him and takes another seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Opening his beverage) I'm tired of those Beacon Point snobs always looking down their noses at us &mdash; who the hell do they think they are?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> This valley's gentry... who can and will get away with murder</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> They're fucking assholes &mdash; that's who they are</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen shakes her head and prepares to serve dinner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> What... the proper term is what they are &mdash; an asshole is technically a what, not a who</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Oh, I see, you think if you talk like them they'll let you join their inner circle? &mdash; that's bullshit, dear brother-in-law - you will always be a wetback to them, no matter how many times you fuck their women</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Slamming her hand down on the table) FRANCIS FIORE, THAT IS ENOUGH &mdash; I will NOT have this talk in my kitchen, I will NOT have this talk in my house</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> It's my house too and I can talk any damn way I choose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> He's right, sis &mdash; if he wants to talk like an ignorant gutter rat, that is his choice &mdash; some of us want to better ourselves and he can't deal with it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Better than what? &mdash; Javier is so busy trying to be something he's not, he forgets about his own wife and children</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Javier is an important man</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Apparently not important enough or his WIFE would be on that SHIP with all the other ice cubes who think they shit gold &mdash; or is it what they shit gold?</p>

<div class="stage">Hector chuckles into his beer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> If anything, those pricks should be spit-shining our shadows &mdash; our families have been in this valley for over two-hundred years</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen sets the table. Frank grabs a hot roll and stuffs it into his mouth.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Honey, could you bring me the butter? &mdash; my great grandfather...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Was an Italian galley cook on a Spanish trading ship &mdash; yes, we all know the story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Whatever he did, he did it well &mdash; all he had to work with was a tiny plot of land and one olive tree &mdash; now look at this place...</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen mutters something under her breath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Almonds, walnuts, pistachios &mdash; when the people of Santa Conchita think of nuts, they think of our family!</p>

<div class="stage">Hector winks and raises his drink in toast.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> I gotta go take a piss</p>

<div class="stage">Frank struggles to his feet, grabs his cane and hobbles out of the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> On your way, please turn the porch light on &mdash; Anita is supposed to be dropping by soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Calling back) Don't even get me started on that one &mdash; KIDS, wake up and go get your dinner!</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen glares at her brother until he gets the hint and helps her with the rest of the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> You didn't answer me earlier...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> There's not much to say</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> There is if Stephanie Gates, the ex Mrs. Martel, is back in your life</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm just helping out a friend, that's all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Mm-hmm...</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen goes over to a stack of old newspapers in the corner and finds one with an article about the Renselier jet almost crashing. There is a stock photo of George, Lydia, and Penelope.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Holding it up) A true miracle</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Looking away) They hit some turbulence, no big deal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> By the grace of God they survived... but we know better, don't we, Hector?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Listen, before Frank gets back, we need to talk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Fine, change the subject if you want</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> We inspected all of the fields today &mdash; nearly two-thirds of them are damaged or destroyed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> We've been through bad seasons before</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> This is more than a season - it will take years, maybe even decades, to get back to our normal harvests</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Ona Rosa gave us the paperwork for a disaster loan</p>

<div class="stage">Hector gets in his sister's face and lowers his voice.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> A government band-aid is not going to help a gaping chest wound &mdash; your husband refuses to see it, please don't go burying your head in the soot as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Pushing him back) And what exactly do you suggest we do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Keep the house and a few acres but sell the rest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Are you loco en la cabeza? &mdash; you just said yourself that the fields are damaged</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> The land still has plenty of value &mdash; the demand for condos and houses in this valley continues to skyrocket</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> No, no, no &mdash; I am not listening to this!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Hermana &mdash; look in the mirror &mdash; you are no longer a young girl, your husband is half a man and your two daughters are not interested in the farm as a full-time job and life...</p>

<div class="stage">Frank and the grandchildren are clopping down the stairs. Carmen gets up to pour herself a glass of water.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Softly) Just think about what I said</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (To the kids) No one touches the tamales until I touch them first!</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen suddenly drops the glass and grabs around her neck. It shatters on the floor as she screams.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> ONI</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside the penthouse suite at the Del Pilar, Anita works out furiously on an elliptical as she watches the rain sheet against the glass windows. Marcy, wearing a skimpy silk robe, strolls over with a cold bottle of water and pecks Anita on the cheek.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Don't you have to be at your folks' place?</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y3c17_marcy_anita.jpg" alt="" h="510" w="565"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I keep finding excuses not to go</p>

<div class="stage">Anita stops her workout and playfully pulls open Marcy's robe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yet another one</p>

<div class="stage">Marcy chuckles as she flops on the sofa.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Yeah, let's enjoy it while we can &mdash; I just spoke to one of the Sig 7 producers, it's not good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Toweling off) I know &mdash; I flew over the cinders of what used to be R'xal's moon palace &mdash; not very palatial</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> He said we have enough episodes in the can for the next month or two but we'll have to find a new location to shoot the rest of the season &mdash; there's talk of Vancouver... even Australia</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Cool</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Hurt) Cool?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Sounds perfect, I'll go with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Too many bad things have been going on around here the last few years, it will be a nice change of pace</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> But how can you? &mdash; your Coast Guard duties...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Holding up her arm cast) One swift blow against a granite countertop and this becomes a permanent disability &mdash; I doubt they'd want me to fly one of their precious birds with one hand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Stunned) Why... would you do that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Let's just say I'm no longer feeling the love for the uniform &mdash; they want us to work triple the amount since 9/11 yet do it with half the funds...</p>

<div class="stage">Anita starts to pace as the lights flicker with the storm.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> And I'm sure as hell not feeling the love for this country &mdash; why should I risk my life when I'm despised for who I am? &mdash; it was hard enough being pissed on for being the poor Latina farmer's daughter, now I get dumb fucks like Lieutenant Vesner throwing their &quot;moral values&quot; shit in my face on a daily basis, but this cocksucker went through three wives, had two illegitimate kids, snorted blow off the asses of Cambodian whores - YET, YET - he's &quot;better&quot; than I am because he's born again &mdash; FUCK THAT &mdash; let the chief chimp sacrifice good old V's blood for the land, I am done!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Babe, calm down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah, calm down, that's what they want us to do, calm down, shut up, get back in the closet, hide behind some prop boyfriend...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Ouch</p>

<div class="stage">Anita chugs her water, goes over to the sofa, and flops next to Marcy.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Unfortunately, your side... our side... assumed a bunch of asexual dancing clowns on TV handing out free makeovers and trips or singing happy songs equated acceptance with the mainstream when it was anything but &mdash; the one thing I learned in this business is that people will gleefully lick your feet to get the best goodie bag yet will secretly hate you the entire time their tongues are wrapped around your toes</p>

<div class="stage">Anita tickles Marcy's feet and then kisses her passionately.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I don't want to live like this anymore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> What about your family?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> That's what Thanksgiving is for &mdash; besides, my sister can take care of our parents, she's their favorite anyway</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Well, she did give them grandchildren</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Shut up</p>

<div class="stage">Anita's cell phone rings a Pat Benatar tune but she ignores it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> Aren't you going to get that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Nah, let them leave a voicemail</p>

<div class="stage">There is a short pause then the phone rings in a solid, low tone. Anita leaps off the sofa and runs for the counter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> SHIT &mdash; that's an emergency alert &mdash; hello? &mdash; yes... WHAT? &mdash; WHERE? &mdash; I'M ON MY WAY</p>

<div class="stage">Anita scoops up her keys and pulls on her shoes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marcy</span> What's going on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Turn on the news!</p>

<div class="stage">On screen is Dan Henshaw. A blurry distance shot of the ocean is behind him and the words &quot;Breaking News&quot; underneath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> KCON has just learned that the Meeramar vessel carrying hundreds of mourners for a memorial service is in danger of sinking off the coast of Duquesa Bay, rescue ships have been deployed but the intensity of this storm is making matters extremely difficult...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Craig is on that ship</p>

<hr>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Running around) LIFE JACKETS, MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS WEARING THEM</p>

<div class="stage">KJ assists his mother and others as they attempt to get below. Erika runs to the side of the ship and tries to see what is happening. An eerie glow flashes in the water, then vanishes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Gritting her teeth) Are you trying to bait me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> ERIKA, GET AWAY FROM THE RAIL</p>

<div class="stage">Erika considers diving over and turning into Darkfin but too many eyes are upon her. As she goes to join the others, she spots a young child out of the corner of her eye. Hannah is playing with a dead bird that was blown on the deck. The ship radically lurches and lists to the side, causing the child to slip.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia &amp; Ben</span> HANNAH</p>

<div class="stage">Erika times her strides and matches the child sliding across the deck. As Hannah goes over the edge, Erika leaps over the rail after her.</div>
