<div class="stage">Inside the SCPD headquarters, Morrigan is being questioned by two detectives. An older man stands with his arms folded, saying
  nothing, while his younger female partner does the talking.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Alright, Ms. McBride, we need to go over your story one more time...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Slumping in her chair) That's what you said the first two times...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> We need to make sure that everything is in sync... and that your story doesn't change</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Bristling) I'm a professional journalist, detective, as well as the daughter of an LAPD commander - I
  always get my facts straight before I commit to them</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Rolling her eyes at her partner) Right</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hey, I am doing you both a favor by talking to you without a lawyer present because I know I didn't do
  anything wrong - so, if you're done with the haughty facial expressions, shall I start from the top?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> I'm not sure I'm liking your tone, ma'am</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And what tone would you prefer? - the &quot;I'm so happy to be accused of murdering a priest&quot; timbre
  or the &quot;whatever you say, almighty officer&quot; cadence?</p>

<div class="stage">The female detective starts to lean into Morrigan with a scowl but is held back by her partner.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Ms. McBride, temper your sarcasm and please tell us about your activities for the evening?</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> As I said before, after getting off of my shift at KCON... 6:30... I went to see that new sci-fi movie
  at the cineplex with five of my friends - you have their names and telephone numbers, they can vouch for me - after it
  was over at 8:50, we all went to dinner at the Mama Toni's Pizza Parlor across the street - I stayed there for approximately
  45 minutes until Hector Tapia called and asked me to meet him at the church</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Saint Brendan's?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, Saint Brendan's</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Banging her pen against the desk) I was going to see that new sci-fi movie tonight... but I got called
  in here!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You didn't miss much</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Growling) That's for me to decide</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Why did Mr. Tapia want you to meet him?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> And if the reason is sexual in nature, you will have to provide exact details</p>

<div class="stage">The two detectives chuckle at each other as Morrigan looks aghast.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Shouldn't be too hard for a &quot;writer&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">They laugh again.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I am two seconds away from filing a report against you two</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Throwing her a pad of paper) Ooh, be our guest!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> No one is really going to care about what you have to say, Ms. McBride - a priest was killed earlier
  this evening - that's not going to sit well with most people in this town</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> And you just handed your own head over to us on a silver platter... pardon the biblical pun</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> If you two would stop the comedy routine and do your jobs right, you would see that I'm only trying to
  help while the real killer is still out there</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> OK, OJ</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Taking a bite of an onion bagel) We'll see what we can do</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I want to speak to your captain, right now - you two are embarrassments to your profession!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Grabbing Morrigan by the collar and deliberately breathing on her) This ain't your daddy's department,
  little girl</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Get used to our faces, Ms. McBride, because we are the only two you're going to be dealing with here
  - now, I suggest you make it easier on yourself and resume your story... why were you going to meet Hector Tapia?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Glaring at both of them) He wanted me to meet his sister, Carmen Fiore - he thought she would be a helpful
  source for a future story I'm doing for KCON</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> What's the story about?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not at liberty to say</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> And why is that?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's going to be an expose and it's still in the nascent stages - discussing it now... with anyone...
  would jeopardize the entire process</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Missy, you have a lot more at stake here than losing a story</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I am well aware of that, detective... and my name is &quot;Morrigan&quot; - but I am also aware of my
  rights under the law - I do not need nor do I wish to discuss the subject of my story as it applies to this investigation</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> (Flipping his pen in the air and catching it) We'll find out about it, one way or the other</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The only thing you need to know is that I went to Saint Brendan's with the intention of meeting Mr. Tapia
  for strictly business purposes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> A man with a known criminal past</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Emphasize the word &quot;past,&quot; please</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> How about you emphasize your ass!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> (Holding back his partner again) And you did see Mr. Tapia?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes... briefly - by the time I arrived at the church, the pizza from earlier was not setting right on
  my stomach so I asked if we could reschedule...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> It was awfully late to be meeting him there in the first place, wasn't it, Ms. McBride?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ordinarily, yes, but tonight was an inter-parish meeting - they usually last well past 10:00 pm</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Did Mr. Tapia watch you leave?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, he did - I drove off to go home</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> You took the back streets instead of the freeway, why?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not a fan of driving freeways after dark, I prefer surface streets</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> (Looking at a map on the wall) You live on Willowbrook, correct?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That is correct</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> The church is a good 20-minute drive on surface streets when you could've been home in 12 using the
  freeway</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> True</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> For someone who was supposedly sick to her stomach, you weren't in a real hurry to get home?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Like I just said, I do not like to drive the freeways after dark - the extra eight minutes was not going
  to help or hurt my stomach</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> And during this time is when you had the accident with Erika von Meer?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Why didn't you report it?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It was both of our faults - there was only minor damage - we didn't see the need to involve our insurance
  companies</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Smug) Well, as the daughter of an LAPD commander, you should have known better!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Gritting her teeth) Look, it's late, I'm tired, sick, and Dr. von Meer had to get to her lab tests...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> You insisted on driving her, why?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Her glasses were damaged and she couldn't see well enough to drive in my opinion - so I offered her a
  ride and she accepted it</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Heh, now was this sexual in nature?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Angrily pointing) YOU ARE A DISGRACE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> ANSWER THE QUESTION, MA'AM</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO - I was trying to be helpful...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Like you're trying to be now?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You know, on second thought, I think I do want a lawyer</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> We spoke to a few of your co-workers already...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> &quot;To&quot; or &quot;with?&quot; - it makes a difference</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> (Ignoring her comment) A Ms. Takanachi said she talked to you by phone after the shooting</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> While I was driving Dr. von Meer to her destination, Gracie called me and told me about what happened</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> (Looking at his notes) According to Ms. Takanachi, she tried to call you several times before, but
  you did not answer - why?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I had my cell voicemail on, I was not feeling well</p>
enough to talk to anyone
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Why did you pick up this time?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Erika suggested that I should</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> And why is that?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Agitated) I DUNNO, the ringing pissed her off, you'll have to ask her!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> So, now you two are heading back towards the church?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, I was only a few minutes away, I wanted to see what was happening</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Why? - you weren't working that assignment for the station</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's my church and I had just left shortly before - I was concerned for Hector... Mr. Tapia</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> And Ms. von Meer was fine with your little detour?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I asked her if it would be alright and she had no problem with it</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> So, you arrive back at Saint Brendan's - do you remember the precise time?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, I was too busy trying to get through the pandemonium to look at my watch</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Then what happened?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> In the course of talking with people, I noticed</p>
you, detective, holding up a gun in a plastic bag to Frank Fiore... I instantly recognized it as mine
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> You were absolutely certain it was yours?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, the distinctive grip was handmade by my father - I knew right away</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Aside) I've seen better grips</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Overhearing) LOOK, detectives - if I wanted to kill someone, why would I admit in front of everyone that
  that was my gun?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Twisted logic is par for the course in most of these cases</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And why would I leave it behind?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Maybe you heard someone coming and dropped it by accident - a lot of reasons...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Maybe God told you to do it</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, I resent that remark, detective - I am a devout Catholic, I've been a member of this church for less
  than a year, what motive could I possibly have for wanting to kill Father Greg?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> That's what we're going to find out, Ms. McBride, I can assure you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sighing) It's so obvious I am being framed here! - why can't you see that?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Have you ever used your gun?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I used it all the time in Montana - going to the firing range was often times the highlight of my weekend</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> What about here in town?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I haven't had the time to do so since I moved to Duquesa Bay</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Things have been pretty hectic for you lately?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You could say that</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> So, you lost your gun when your first moved out here?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I didn't lose it... it was taken from me</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> By the Tooth Fairy?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> By a California Highway Patrol officer</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Same difference</p>

<div class="stage">The two detectives chuckle.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It was taken by an Officer Baten</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> There's no record of any officer by that name</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Gracie Takanachi and the tow truck driver will back me up on this - the night I first arrived in town,
  my car broke down, I decided to stay where I was and go for help in the morning - I kept the gun by my side for protection
  - a few hours later, I woke up to find Gracie, the tow truck driver, and Officer Baten standing outside of my car - the
  officer took the gun from me since the car was being towed and I had to go directly to work that day</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> And you never went back to claim it?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Between the chaos of the move, my new job, and various other incidents, it slipped my mind - when it finally
  occurred to me to retrieve it, I called CHP HQ and was given the run around... I called from KCON, pull the phone records
  if you don't believe me</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> We know how to do our jobs, ma'am</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's debatable!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> What is your relationship to Erika von Meer?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excuse me? - I've told you three times now why she was in my car</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Yes, but what is your personal relationship to her?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't understand what you're trying to get at?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Is it true that you're dating her brother, KJ von Meer?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her head) Yeah - I told you that he was one of the friends I was with earlier this evening</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> How long have you two been dating?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> For a few months</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Would you call it serious?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Folding her arms) I'd call it dating</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Would you call him your boyfriend?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I still don't see the relevance here?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> Maybe your &quot;car accident&quot; happened last night... or last week</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What are you trying to say?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Leaning on the table again) That the sister of your boyfriend wouldn't hesitate in covering up for
  you!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Standing up) OH, C'MON - I don't know Erika von Meer as well as her brother but I highly doubt she'd
  cover for me if she thought I was jaywalking, let alone plotting the murder of a priest!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Were there any witnesses to your accident tonight?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> None that I'm aware of but it did take place in a residential area - someone might have seen us out there
  when it happened</p>

<div class="stage">The door to the interrogation room opens and Joenne Mirabello enters with a pot of coffee.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> Fresh Kona Blend, detectives!</p>

<div class="stage">Both look at her with deep appreciation as she bends over to fill their mugs. Morrigan quickly stifles her surprise.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> (All smiles) I just finished typing up your reports and the FedEx package you were expecting arrived a few
  minutes ago</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> (Leering at her body) Thanks, Joenne, we're about through in here</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Turning to face Morrigan) Oh, and Ms. McBride - you were asking me earlier about the restroom - it's down
  the hall and to your left when you're ready</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh... thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne smiles once again and does a dance step out the door. Detective 2 watches with a goofy grin as Detective 1 bats him
  on the arm.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 2</span> Ahem... right now, we don't have enough to charge you, Ms. McBride, but I wouldn't be making any out-of-town
  plans</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Detective 1</span> And get in touch with that attorney because you're going to be seeing a lot more of us!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Heading for the door) I'll be sure to do that</p>

<div class="stage">Following Joenne's instructions, Morrigan enters the bathroom. She pretends to fix herself in the mirror as an elderly lady
  finishes washing her hands. Joenne enters the room and looks under the stall doors for feet. Confident that they're alone,
  the two women begin to talk.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> Did you mention me?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What do you think?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> Keep your mouth shut about what went down between us earlier and my supervisors will try to help you out
  the best they can</p>

<p>
  <img src="../assets/images/y2c14_morri_joenne.jpg" h="548" w="620" b="0">
</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And if I don't?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> Pray that they have cable in the prison they send you to</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The way this case is shaping up, Joenne, I might need you to testify on my behalf</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> Sorry, Morrigan, you're on your own - the agency won't</p>
jeopardize my cover for this
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You seemed more than eager to help me out earlier</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> The Clergy is behind setting you up - you do realize this?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How do I know that, because YOU say so? - you told me not to go into the church because my life was at
  risk, the next thing I know, a priest is killed and I'm the number one suspect - WHO KNOWS, maybe your CIA goons are setting
  me up, I can't trust anyone!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Serious look) Be prepared, the detectives will find matching powder burns on your hand</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Leaning against the tile) Oh, I'm sure they will,</p>
they'll probably conjure up some kind of problem between me and Father Greg as well
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> You have a lot of powerful enemies in this town lining up to play puppet master with you, Morrigan</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And where do your strings lead to, Ms. Mirabello?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> Not to The Clergy... if you weren't valuable to these hooded freaks, you would have been dead the second
  you crossed city limits</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why am I so valuable to them?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> It's a puzzle I've been trying to solve for a long time - just know that they need you out of the way...
  but they also need you alive</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Running her hands under the cold water) That's reassuring</p>

<div class="stage">Another woman enters the restroom.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Joenne</span> If you have any other questions I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to call the office - have a
  good evening and I'll be in touch!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Watching her leave) Thank you so much!</p>

<div class="stage">As the woman enters a stall, Morrigan returns to the sink and splashes several handfuls of cold water on her face. She stares
  at herself in the mirror for a moment and then leaves. A few minutes later, the other woman exits the restroom. Now with
  the room completely empty, two feet jump down off of a toilet seat and Erika von Meer silently emerges from a stall.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> This is not going well</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Now standing outside on the building steps, Morrigan talks to Gracie on her cell phone.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I appreciate your help, Gracie - we really have to find that tow truck driver and the mysterious Officer
  Baten because the police will say you're not a credible witness being my friend and co-worker... no, my car has been impounded,
  KJ is inside trying to argue on my behalf but it won't do any good - someone is hell bent on seeing me take the fall for
  this - no, I do NOT want to involve my dad yet... that's OK, KJ will give me a ride home - I know, I'm guessing I'll be
  suspended from KCON next - we'll meet up tomorrow, tell Zach I'll need him to call in his contacts - right now, I've got
  to get home and get some rest before I fall over... thanks, goodnight</p>

  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sighing) I doubt your magic wand can rescue me from this mess</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly feeling a hand on her shoulder, Morrigan whirls around to find Dr. von Meer.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Is everything alright, Ms. McBride?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh, it's you, Dr. von Meer - you startled me</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I apologize... and please call me Erika, we've known each other long enough now</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I suppose we have - how's your eye?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> It's fine... did I hear you mention a &quot;magic wand?&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Um, just talking out loud</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> To an invisible wizard?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) That's one way of describing her</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Morrigan... I want you to know...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm going to do everything I can to clear your name</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Just tell the truth and everything will be alright</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> It doesn't always work out that way</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, but I have to have faith that it will</p>

<div class="stage">The two are silent for a moment.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Did the dicks take your statement?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Pardon me?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The detectives</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes, I echoed everything you said - and I'll say anything else you want me to say</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, that will NOT be necessary</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> It might be... and it might be necessary for you to leave town for awhile - my family has a cabin in...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO... THANK YOU - I do not run from a fight, especially one that is unjust</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> You need to learn to pick your battles</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And you need to get to a hospital for that eye, the cut is still bleeding</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Backing away) I'll take care of it when I get home</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> KJ will be here in a minute to drive us</p>

<div class="stage">As the two wait, Erika notices Morrigan's extremely flushed cheeks.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> It's now my turn to ask... do you need to see a doctor?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No...</p>

<div class="stage">Her gaze returns out to sea.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nothing a few empty robes and a cold soak won't cure</p>
