      <h1>Year 3, Chapter 10: Circle Break</h1>
      <p>Morrigan is brought back by Darkfin but she is not herself. After nearly taking out Darkfin with the trident, Morrigan settles down and the two run for safety through the foothills. They avoid a search helicopter and coyotes by taking shelter at Tim&rsquo;s family cabin. Darkfin tries to regenerate in the shower when Morrigan sneaks a peak and is stunned by the human silhouette.</p>

<div class="stage">With a lifeless Morrigan in her arms, Darkfin stumbles 
 out of the river and falls to the bank. Mt. Wiggins continues to explode 
 in the distance.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c10_df_morri.jpg" h="406" w="560"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Come on, Morrigan, keep fighting</p>

<div class="stage">Inside Morrigan's mind, she hears Darkfin's words but 
 cannot respond. She also hears the comforting tones of her mother's 
 ancient lullaby.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (In her mind) Mom - where are you?</p>

<div class="stage">Meanwhile, a frantic Darkfin desperately searches Morrigan's 
 body for signs of life. No breath, no pulse, nothing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> DO NOT LEAVE ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (In her mind) I'm here... I'm right here - feel me, 
 I know you can!</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin pounds her fist in anger on the ground. Taking 
 a deep breath, she continues to perform CPR on an eerily cold Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Choking with tears) NO, NO, NOT AGAIN - NOT LIKE 
 SAMMY</p>

<div class="stage">Aleta Oscura spends several more minutes working in vain. 
 Sick and weakened herself, she crumples on top of McBride and begins 
 to sob uncontrollably.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (In her mind) DON'T GIVE UP, YOU KNOW I'M STILL WITH 
 YOU</p>

<div class="stage">An odd calm washes over Darkfin as she pulls back from 
 the body. Suddenly, a wave of rage causes her to snatch the glowing 
 crystal off of Morrigan's neck.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Smashing it into shards) NO MORE</p>

<div class="stage">The crystal pops and crackles as tiny flecks of light 
 dissipate into the air. Morrigan's eye fly open, they are glowing the 
 same orange color as the crystal, the same color her mother's eyes once 
 did. Her head and torso spring upright as she sucks in a huge, rattling 
 breath.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c10_morri_eyes.jpg" h="427" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Morrigan?</p>

<div class="stage">The Marked One is now on her feet. A primal shriek is 
 unleashed from her mouth as the ground shakes directly beneath them. 
 Paralyzed by multiple emotions, Darkfin can only watch as Morrigan demonically 
 wails and flails in the direction of the volcano.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Unearthly voice) NOW</p>

<div class="stage">As quickly as it erupted, Mount Wiggins abruptly ceases 
 its pyrotechnics. Morrigan now turns to the river and raises her arm. 
 The trident comes flying out to meet her grasp. The weapon is now enshrouded 
 with the same orange glow. Darkfin is back on her heels in awe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Timidly) Morrigan</p>

<div class="stage">Still possessed, Morrigan's whole body reflects this 
 as veins bulge and her muscles tense. She whirls around and prepares 
 to plunge the trident directly into the heart of Darkfin.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c10_morri_trident.jpg" h="534" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Unafraid) Release!</p>

<div class="stage">The sight of the Aleta Oscura briefly softens McBride. 
 She now whips around in the opposite direction and launches the trident 
 at the Kiyomi mountain range. It soars into the air, well past the river.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> It has subsided</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (A soft whisper) For now...</p>

<div class="stage">She collapses to the ground, curls up into the fetal 
 position and slowly starts to rock. Unable to find words, Darkfin inches 
 over and touches her fingers with hers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Grabbing her hand) Hold me... please</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin pulls Morrigan into a protective embrace and 
 the two stay on the ground, consoling each other in silence. Moments 
 pass.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Tell me about Sammy</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin jumps up and turns her back to Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> We have to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Where?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin notices a helicopter on approach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Away from here - come</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan struggles to her feet. She feels the scaly arms 
 of Darkfin wrap around her for support and the two start to walk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> This is the second time you've saved me from that 
 river</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> And, hopefully, the last</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I can safely say that this time outdid the other 
 rescue, exploding train and all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> I do not look forward to outdoing ourselves again</p>

<div class="stage">Aleta Oscura doubles over and succumbs to a coughing 
 fit. She is gradually losing her color and her morph.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You don't look so good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> When have I ever looked good?</p>

<div class="stage">This remark causes both of them to smile.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> We need to reach higher ground</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> The lava and ash are flowing in the other direction</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Mount Wiggins is the least of my concerns - it is 
 too unpredictable out here in the open, we must find shelter</p>

<div class="stage">The two tread along the hillsides of the Don Alessandros. 
 They go deeper into the trees for cover.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I heard them talking... they called me a &quot;Taint&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Keep moving</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> One of them couldn't believe the &quot;Marked One&quot; 
 would be a Taint - do you know what that means?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> We will discuss it later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Later, later, later - what happens when later is 
 no longer an option?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Watch your step</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I'm so tired...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> I know - we will find a place soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> No, I mean, yeah, I'm tired physically - but I'm 
 more tired mentally - I'm tired of all this intrigue and hocus pocus, 
 I'm tired of being a fugitive... I'm really tired of running around 
 naked</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> You look fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Do I?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Um... you can grab some leafy branches if it will 
 make you feel better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Will it make you feel better?</p>

<div class="stage">There is a noticeable pause.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> What will make me feel better is cold water... cold 
 salt water</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> It's one long walk to the ocean - I can barely see 
 as it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> No, we will not make it that far - there are cabins 
 ahead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> How do you know?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin is suddenly silent.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You have human friends, don't you?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin does not respond.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Other friends besides me... why am I suddenly jealous 
 of that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Do not be</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> But, then again, I'm not exactly human, am I?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Morrigan...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Giddy) Neither are you - we're the perfect pair 
 of freaks - let's throw a party!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Stop it...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> We can play board games and serve turducken - of 
 course, that will all be contingent on whether the world blows up or 
 not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Clutching her face) STOP... IT... NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I love you</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin freezes on those words. The two stare at each 
 other for a long minute until they both back away in shock.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> That just kind of slipped out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> You are under pressure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Maybe... but it doesn't make it any less true - do 
 you love me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Please do not ask me that now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> When? - LATER?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> We need to focus on what is happening now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I agree... that's why I said it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> We should be nearing the cabins</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You love Sammy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Agitated) She is no longer of this earth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> But you still love her, you can hear the reverence 
 in your voice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> And she lost her life because she knew too much</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I'm... I'm sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Turning around) I cannot... I WILL not let that happen 
 to you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Moving closer) I honestly don't think either one 
 of us can stop what is inevitable</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> What do you know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> A lot more than before</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin glances down at Morrigan's legs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> You are bleeding</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan carefully wipes the corners of Darkfin's mouth 
 with her fingers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> So are you</p>

<div class="stage">A rustle in the bushes causes both of them to tense.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Stay behind me!</p>

<div class="stage">Five snarling coyotes reveal themselves and surround 
 the two.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> I wish you had not thrown my trident so far</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You'd be dead right now if I didn't</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin is stunned by those words. With a swift, nonchalant 
 motion, Morrigan picks up a heavy stone and zeros in on the alpha animal. 
 It is brained before Darkfin can even process what is happening. The 
 others scamper away without a whimper.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> What has come over you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I wish I knew... where did you say those cabins were 
 again?</p>

<div class="stage">The two continue up a small trail in silence. It is now 
 Darkfin's turn to trail behind, growing weaker with each step.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Pointing) There... to the left</p>

<div class="stage">A small A-frame nestled among a grove a trees comes into 
 view. An exuberant Morrigan practically carries Darkfin the remaining 
 steps as they make their way to the entrance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> This is so cliche!</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin leans over the porch and vomits up squid bits.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Well, almost</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> I fail to see the humor in any of this right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Can't you? - it's like being trapped in my very own 
 version of Days of Our Lives - or, better yet, a bad Sigma Seven marathon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> When is Sigma Seven good?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> So, you DO watch TV</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin limps over and feebly tries to kick in the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> We need to get inside</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is already fumbling around the mailbox and potted 
 plants. She finds a key hidden underneath the birdbath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Jumping over) People are so predictable - open sesame!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Turning the lock) Enough with the ebullience</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> It's weird, it's like I'm on some sort of sugar high 
 - look at what else I found...</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan proudly holds up a black feather and goes to 
 tickle Darkfin's nose with it. Darkfin falls to the ground with a seizure.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Running inside) Not good</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan hunts around for a blanket, finds one and rushes 
 it over to a twitching Darkfin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Wait... she said she needed cold - cold water - salt 
 water</p>

<div class="stage">Using the blanket as a sling, Morrigan hauls Darkfin 
 over to the bathroom and gingerly places her into the combo shower/tub.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Turning the faucet on full) I've seen hideous shower 
 curtains before but this one takes the cake - Gracie has been outdone</p>

<div class="stage">The rush of cold water snaps Darkfin back to consciousness. 
 Her arm fins expand, ready to fight.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> WHOA, put those away - those aren't tub toys!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> What... what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You blacked out there for a minute</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Relaxing in the water) How did I get in here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I asked the neighbor down the road to lift you in 
 - his name is Bill, he has a bulbous red nose</p>

<div class="stage">Not realizing the joke, Darkfin panics and scans around 
 the cabin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> FOOL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> CALM DOWN... I'm kidding</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin slumps under the water and remains there as Morrigan 
 sits on the side of the tub.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I remember this time in second grade when I won a 
 goldfish at the school fair - I tried to hide him in the pool because 
 my dad didn't want any more pets...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Popping her head up and gasping) SALT... I need salt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> OK</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan runs to the kitchen and finds a half-empty saltshaker.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Returning) Will this do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Dumping it into the water) It is not enough - use 
 canned soups if you have to</p>

<div class="stage">This causes Morrigan to chuckle as she snatches two cans 
 of chicken broth from the cupboard.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> All I need is some cayenne pepper and you'll make 
 a fine jambalaya!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> (Sighing) Why must you do that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Do what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Make light of everything?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Defense mechanism... why do you have to be such a 
 cold, terse bitch?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin blinks at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Uh-huh - fish or no fish, you're a bitch!</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin grimaces in pain as the changes in her metabolism 
 continue.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> It has nothing to do... with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Growing scared) You... you're not going to belly 
 up on me, are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> I should be fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I don't like &quot;should&quot; - could you change 
 that to &quot;will?&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan takes Darkfin's hand in hers and squeezes it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> It's not like I can just flush you, you know</p>

<div class="stage">They both smile at the comment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Do you need more salt? - I think I saw a bag of potato 
 chips in there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> No - there is nothing more to be done... GO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> WHAT? - where?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Darkfin</span> Go to the other room and find some clothes - rest 
 - let me rest... in private</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> But...</p>

<div class="stage">Before Morrigan can utter another word, Darkfin is out 
 of the tub, ushering Morrigan out the door, and locking it behind her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> HEY... what if... what if you need oyster crackers?</p>

<div class="stage">The sound of the running shower water is now heard as 
 a miffed Morrigan finds an ugly camo hunting shirt to slip on. She finds 
 some even uglier neck ties from the 70's in the closet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Cleaning herself up) Maybe she'd let me stay if 
 I were hogtied and blindfolded? - nah... I've had way too much of that 
 with the hooded creeps</p>

<div class="stage">McBride paces around the cabin, pulling the shades and 
 taking inventory.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> When Fin feels better, we need to put all our cards 
 on the table - everything, and I do mean everything, needs to be discussed!</p>

<div class="stage">An bronze statue of an angry bird gawks at her from a 
 bookshelf.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What are you looking at? - huh, where have I seen 
 you before? - it would be so refreshing to see an actual smile for once</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan fetches herself a glass of water and studies 
 the liquid before gulping it down.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Hmmph - she isn't the only one hurting right now 
 - I'm hurting, real bad - is it asking too much for a just a little 
 solace, is it?</p>

<div class="stage">A gleaming nail file comes into her view.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Looking at the bathroom door) Hmm</p>

<div class="stage">With eager stealth, McBride takes the file and approaches 
 the bathroom door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Muttering) Like it or not, people comfort each other 
 in times of crisis, not hide in separate rooms...</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan successfully picks the lock and opens the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Entering) Maybe you want to be a cold fish, literally, 
 but I...</p>

<div class="stage">She is stunned to find a very human silhouette behind 
 the frosted shower curtain.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c10_shower.jpg" h="422" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You ARE human!</p>
