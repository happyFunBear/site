<div class="stage">Thoroughly bored and swiveling around in her office chair, Erika von Meer listens to Griffin Martel drone on and on to the Meeramar employees about the recent break-in and resulting increased security measures.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> And I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, I am fine... a little unsettled but fine...</p>

<div class="stage">Erika rolls her eyes as KJ shows up, taking a seat beside her.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c12_erika.jpg" h="504" w="470"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Did I miss anything?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> A vintage whine from Grif - what are you doing here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I had some extra time and thought I'd swing by for company morale, that kind of thing - where's dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> He and Doug had some real business to take care of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Strutting around the employees) The good news in all of this is that nothing of importance, work-wise, was taken</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Heh, he only lost some money and a watch - both of which he can easily replace... his pride is another thing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> How did you know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Know what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Griffin didn't want anyone to know what was taken from him - he didn't even file a police report</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Catching herself) I've known the man, in every way, since we were born - I can easily deduce what he's hiding... and he's now wearing the watch I gave him three Christmases ago</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Smirking) Damn, Sis, you are in the wrong profession - you should be a detective</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Raising an eyebrow) I'm sure law enforcement would just love to have me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Banging his fist down on a desk) And I promise every one of you that this kind of harrowing experience will NOT happen again!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Under her breath) PLEASE, Griffin, grow a spine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Hearing what she said) Cut him some slack, Rik, you weren't there - it was pretty nasty the way he was tied up, and it could have been a lot worse</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> How's the security guard doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Better... he has a moderate concussion and the details are still fuzzy as to what went down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> He didn't see his attacker?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No... at least not a clear face - he mentioned something about a hood</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Huh... well, I suppose that's typical for a robbery</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> What I don't understand is why wait until Griffin was in a high security building? - it would have been easier to just jack him in a dark parking lot or something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Obviously, the building wasn't secure enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I know, that's why I initially thought it was an inside job, someone trying to pirate corporate secrets</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What changed your mind?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Griffin - he swears to me that nothing was touched... she went right for his watch and money</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Coughing) SHE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Yeah, he definitely said it was a woman's voice although she tried to disguise it... he's not sure but he thinks he's heard it before</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Stiffening) Really</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Concluding his address) Once again, we deeply appreciate and value your continued loyalty to Meeramar, I am more than confident that this was an isolated incident and it is indeed safe to come to work... thank you and goodnight!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Flipping open his cell phone and dialing) Hey, Morrigan, it's Kage - look, I'm so sorry Isaacson was a jerk tonight - how about the two of us going for a hike this weekend? - call me back, 'bye!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What happened with Zach?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> We were all having a good time until Eyes started ragging on her about not drinking beer - wow, I'll tell ya, she sure shut everyone up and slaughtered the happy mood with her response!</p>

<div class="stage">KJ looks off and shakes his head. There is a silent pause.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Impatient) WELL?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Hmm?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What did she say?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Oh... it's a long, ugly story - let me try to sum it up in a sentence... she was involved in a drunk driving accident when she was a kid, her brother was killed and her mom's head ended up in her lap, something about Neil Diamond, and beer was the root cause</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> DEAR GOD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I know, I thought she was joking at first... you know  how writers love to tell stories... but I recognized from the expression  on her face that she wasn't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Did she leave right after that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Pretty much - Gracie said she took off for Saint Brendan's... probably to pray for some new friends</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Getting up) You know what, I forgot to check with Shelby on some lab results, please tell Grif...</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin Martel now approaches them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You can tell me yourself, Rikka</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I apologize but I must get going</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Grabbing her elbow) Whatever it is will have to wait</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Snapping it back) Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> We have some business to take care of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Look, I was here all evening</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> And that's why you can spare another ten minutes... for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Winking at his sister) I'll see you two later</p>

<div class="stage">Erika glowers at her brother as she follows behind Griffin.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Outside in the church parking lot, Morrigan and Joenne Mirabello continue their conversation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Joenne, I really do not appreciate cryptic warnings - what are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Who is &quot;Bouillabaisse?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Answer my question first - I want to know why I can't go inside the church?</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne looks around and pulls Morrigan over to hidden archway.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> It is not safe for you inside</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Growing frustrated) YES, you already established that by saying I should &quot;value my life&quot; - WHY?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I have reason to believe something is going to happen here tonight... in fact, I'm most certain of it</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c12_joenne_mori.jpg" h="423" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Nuh-uh, I answered your question, now tell me who Bouillabaisse is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's an important informant for a future KCON story, I cannot reveal the identity and I cannot say another word - in fact, WHY am I saying ANY words to a temp secretary?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> You sure enjoy the question, &quot;why&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's my job... it's my life</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Irritated) FYI, I am A LOT more than a temp secretary!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm starting to figure that out - here's a new question for you - WHAT are you then?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Your one true ally in this town</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Shaking her head) Oh, Ms. Mirabello, PLEASE - this conversation is about eight seconds away from ending</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Let's just say we have a mutual enemy in The Clergy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What in the hell are you talking about? - I have no problems with this church!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Not THIS clergy... THE CLERGY - at least, that's the nickname we've given them - they have some ancient Latin title but it's easier to call them &quot;The Clergy&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan looks completely baffled.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> How about &quot;Hooded Goons?&quot; - does that ring a bell, Morrigan?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Catching her breath) Oh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Doing a pirouette for emphasis) Yep</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How much do you know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> PLENTY, I dare say more than you at this point</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Care to share?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Not here, not now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her head) Here we go again!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is that all you know about... &quot;The Clergy?&quot; - is that it?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Why? - is there more I should know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Evil grin) Not here, not now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> HA - I'll be sure to tell my superiors that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Something tells me these &quot;superiors&quot; are concerned with more than the copying machine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Let's just say that a certain segment of the United States government has taken notice of Duquesa Bay recently... and it's not for the waterfront property</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Tell me, is Justine in on this, too?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> NO, my sister is NOT involved nor does she need to be... is that understood?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> So, do you trust me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How about a firm &quot;maybe?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Hey, I took a big risk in revealing myself to you here tonight - please get back in your car and go home - we'll rendezvous in a few days</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> CALL me, don't IM me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Quizzical stare) Whatever</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside the parish hall, Hector Tapia speaks with Carmen and Frank Fiore as the church business is concluded.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (All smiles) Padre Juan was telling me about a significant anonymous donation made to Saint B's yesterday and that they have generously agreed to split it with &quot;Our Lady&quot; - we can finally get the air conditioning fixed!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Grumbling) I already fixed it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> You TRIED to fix it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Looking at his watch) Morrigan should have been here by now, I wonder what's keeping her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> It's probably for the best that she doesn't come here - we don't need news people poking around our ancestors' burial grounds</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Isn't it her job to poke around?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> When there is a STORY to be told - the Chumash resting place in the Kiyomis has already been told and retold</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Maybe she's approaching it from another angle?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> We don't need KCON's angle of exploitation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Ms. McBride is NOT that kind of journalist, Carmenita, you have my word on this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Hmm... and what &quot;word&quot; is that, hermano?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Chuckling) Can I pick it out?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Sighing) I'm going to go check for her outside, please do not leave here until I return</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Diez minutos solamente!</p>

<div class="stage">Hector nods to his sister as he heads for the door. Exiting the side entrance, he spots Morrigan getting back into her car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> MS. MCBRIDE, WAIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself) Aww, damn!</p>

<div class="stage">Hector jogs over to her car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I was just coming to see where you were - why are you leaving?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sorry, Hector - I ate some bad pizza and I'm not really up to this right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm sorry - I think Father Greg has some antacid, let me go see</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Starting the engine) UM - no, really, that's OK - please tell your sister I would love to reschedule in the next few days but I genuinely need to go home... now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Somewhat hurt) Alright... please feel better soon</p>

<div class="stage">Hector watches Morrigan drive off and heads back towards the church. He is distracted along the way by a broken sprinkler head. Over the next several minutes, he goes about fixing it when a loud bang suddenly cracks the air. The screams of a woman quickly follow.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Running inside the church) CARMEN... CARMEN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> HECTOR, COME QUICK</p>

<div class="stage">He runs into the chapel and finds a handful of people gathered around a fallen priest.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c12_priest.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> FATHER GREG HAS BEEN SHOT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> DID ANYONE SEE WHAT HAPPENED?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> NO, WE ALL RAN IN HERE AFTER WE HEARD THE BANG</p>

<div class="stage">Hector kneels next to the bleeding man and finds no pulse. He tries to put pressure on the gaping chest wound but, in his mind, he knows it is futile.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> CALL THE POLICE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Sobbing) Gladys is already doing that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Hobbling towards the door) I'M GONNA GET MY RIFLE OUT OF THE TRUCK - THE SHOOTER MIGHT STILL BE IN HERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> SIT DOWN, FRANCIS, YOU'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY</p>

<div class="stage">Frank ignores him and disappears behind the ornately carved oak door as Carmen begins to pray. Moments later, the Fiore patriarch returns with a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> DAMMIT, FRANK, PUT THAT AWAY, WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE TROUBLE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Inspecting it) It's not mine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Padre Juan and I found it on the church steps</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> And now your prints are on it... PERFECTO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> PLEASE, PLEASE, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE HELP FATHER GREG?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Taking her hand) Help is on the way... but I'm afraid it's too late</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen looks down at the blood on Hector's fingers and runs out of the room, wailing with the other women.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Casually taking a seat on the leather sofa inside his office, Griffin motions to Erika to join him. There is a small, candlelit dinner laid out on the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Crab salad... your favorite!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Tempted by the meal) Griffin, I honestly don't have time for this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I am making you find the time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I thought you said this had to do with business?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Everything we do affects our family, ergo, it affects the business</p>

<div class="stage">Erika huffs and takes a bite of the salad.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I need you...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> GRIFFIN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> LET ME FINISH... I need you to work with me on a very important project - I was hoping your brother could handle it... but you know KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What does this involve?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Sit and relax, eat your salad, I have a video presentation that will help make sense</p>

<div class="stage">He turns on one of the video monitors on the wall and it shows a security camera view of the interior.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Whoops - forgot to get rid of this first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Slightly recognizing it) What is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> The intruder who attacked me the other night used a video loop on the surveillance tape - fortunately, the electronic equipment required to pull it off was left behind during the excitement - it's only a matter of time before my people track down its source</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Almost dropping her fork) That's fortunate</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Resetting the monitor) Ah, this should do it</p>

<div class="stage">Before he has a chance to start the tape, the monitor is on regular television. Flashing across the screen is a breaking KCON news story.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Eyes lighting up) WAIT... DON'T SWITCH IT YET</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> But...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Grabbing the remote and turning it up) SHHHHH</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c12_dan_kcon.jpg" h="382" w="470"  b="0"></p>


<div class="stage">Dan Henshaw is on screen with an image of Saint Brendan's church in the background.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> We have breaking news at this hour - a reported shooting has taken place at Saint Brendan's Catholic Church where at least one person has been killed - we are expecting more details any moment now as...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> GREAT, that's all this town needs</p>

<div class="stage">Before he can say another word, Erika bolts out of the room.</div>
