      <p>Inside a clandestine office, Doug calls Griffin to oversee the drilling in the Kiyomis. They argue when Griffin alerts him to a potential problem. Doug and Turner posture over the power of the white robe. Penny assists a weakened Darkfin and they take on the hoods with Anita and Morrigan. Jason is killed and Hector betrays his family as a massive explosion rocks the hospital. The real white robed leader watches from a distance &#150; Samadara has returned!</p>

<div class="stage">On the outskirts of Chaparral Heights, a white limo reflects the dim street lights as it pulls into an industrial complex. Doug Martel steps out of the vehicle and hurries inside an unremarkable three-story office building. There is no one inside as he passes through several elaborate security screenings. The last one requires him to blow into a tube as his pulse and eye are scanned. A large, metallic door flies open and Doug struts inside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Monotone) Activate full display</p>

<div class="stage">The darkened room instantly springs to life with lights and charts. A 3D model of the entire Santa Conchita Valley rises up in the center of the room. Doug focuses his attention on a detailed drilling structure at the base of the Kiyomi Mountains.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Everything is finally in place</p>

<div class="stage">He now saunters over to a cabinet, fetches a bottle of aged bourbon and pours himself a drink. As he downs the contents of the glass, he stares at the flowing white robe hanging before him on a hook.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Inspecting a sleeve) This needs a good cleaning</p>

<div class="stage">The Martel patriarch slips it off the hook and throws it on. He then presses the buttons on a speaker phone. Griffin answers the other end.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Progress report!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Crackling over the speaker) This fluke storm caused some minor flooding but we're still ready to go operational in the next few hours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I want a specific time, not vague projections</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Machines whir in the background) Can't do that, father, all I can give you is the best estimate &mdash; we've already pushed this project so far ahead of the original time frame, we're lucky to&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">Doug snaps off the call with a flippant finger push. He paces the room and studies the glowing charts when the phone rings back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Answering) What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (On the other end) I am tired of you hanging up on me before I finish and, before you do so again, you need to be made aware of a growing complication!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> That is why I put YOU in charge of overseeing this &mdash; it is up to YOU to deal with the complications</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> AND THIS IS WHY I AM OUT HERE IN THE RAIN AND THE MUD AND WHY I GAVE UP GOING TO THE FUNERAL OF THE FATHER OF THE WOMAN WHO MEANS MORE TO ME THAN ANYTHING AND THE MAN WHO WAS MORE OF A FATHER TO ME THAN YOU COULD EVER POSSIBLY HOPE TO BE</p>

<div class="stage">It is now Griffin's turn to end the phone call abruptly. Doug sends the phone flying across the room. Before he can turn back to the display, a cold fist knocks him to the floor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Get out of my robe!</p>

<div class="stage">Doug regains his composure, scrambles to his feet and cowers in the corner. He quickly sloughs off the white garment and timidly hands it over to Turner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I apologize</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Snatching it from him) Your power envy is nauseating, Douglas</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I have proven my loyalty to you, Gates, over and over again &mdash; I deserve to be treated better than a faceless underling</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tuner</span> My sister deserved to be treated better than a faceless broodmare</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> HALF sister</p>

<div class="stage">Doug is elevated of the ground with a flick of Turner's hand. He levitates in the middle of the room, gasping for breath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Do NOT underestimate my affection for Stephanie and her children &mdash; their only misfortune is having you for a father</p>

<div class="stage">Doug drops to the floor and thinks twice about going after Turner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> You are not one of us, Martel, and you never will be</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Without me YOU would not be where you are</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Let's cut the theatrics and get down to business&hellip; what is the status of the drilling?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I just got off the phone with Griffin&hellip;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> So, that is why it is across the room in pieces</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Please don't interrupt me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> It is set to begin in the next hour or so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Any problems?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> None</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> That's good &mdash; I was concerned the soot from the volcano would clog the pipes</p>

<div class="stage">Doug thinks back to what Griffin was trying to warn him about as Turner now dons the white robe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> My son reports no problems</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Evil grin) We are so very close</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> I am pleased Griffin is there to see this through &mdash; do you think Karl John will do his share?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Now that his father is out of the way, thanks to you, he will not be a problem</p>

<div class="stage">Turner now paces the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Erika was more of a threat since she had the brains for Meeramar - fortunately for us, she'd rather play with starfish</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Tapping his fingers together) Hmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> By the way, I appreciate you getting rid of von Meer &mdash; he's been more of a hindrance than a friend or business partner these last few years</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Do not thank me yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Nearly choking on his tongue) What do you mean? &mdash; he's DEAD, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> I'm not certain</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> OH, THAT'S PERFECT &mdash; not only did I lose my PREMIER TANKER TODAY, it was for NOTHING?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Do NOT raise your voice to me, Douglas</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> What about HER? &mdash; has she been taken care of yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> SHE is my concern, not yours&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">Turner pulls the hood over his head and goes to leave.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Before vanishing) The harvesting flock has been dispatched</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Sneaking inside the hospital through her usual route, Darkfin does not waste time with a disguise. As two orderlies cross her path in the hall, she knocks them both out before either one can react.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Hustling down a corridor) Quickly, quickly, quickly</p>

<div class="stage">She hears the wheels of a gurney advancing in her direction. She flips up to the ceiling and sticks there as a nurse and patient go by. The half-conscious patient sees Darkfin hanging above him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Putting her finger to her lips) Shh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Patient</span> (To the nurse) What did they give me in this IV?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Jumping down) Almost there</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin hurries up a flight of stairs and makes it inside the supply room before more doctors walk by.#</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Sorry, Stephanie</p>

<div class="stage">Opening a large bio hazard bag, Darkfin begins to fill it with syringes, vials, IV bags, pills, and other materials.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Searching another cabinet) Where did you hide the sodium compounds?</p>

<div class="stage">As she goes to reach the top shelf, Darkfin becomes dizzy and falls to the floor. She notices the patches of human flesh getting wider and sprouts of blonde hair on her head.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y3c20_df_partial.jpg" alt="" h="387" w="510"  b="0">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Not now, please not now!</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin starts to vomit as blood drips from her nose. She does not notice the door open in back of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Need some help, Fish Lady?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Penelope</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Eyes glowing again) 'Cause I sure could use yours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Wheezing) Saline solution&hellip; top shelf?</p>

<div class="stage">Penny rummages through the supplies and finds a large vile.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Holding it up to Darkfin) Is this it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> YES</p>

<div class="stage">Aleta Oscura grabs the vile, pops a syringe, fills it with the fluid, and jabs the needle into her neck vein.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Ouch&hellip; cool</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin's transmogrification does not progress any further.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Attempting to stand) How&hellip; how did you know I was here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Helping her) I wondered about that myself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Studying her eyes) You are one of them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I guess I am but I have no idea who or what THEM is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I will explain it to you - another time &mdash; I need to get back to&hellip;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Pushing Darkfin back) Uh-uh, you need to explain it to me right now!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Penelope, please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Or your little secret WON'T be safe with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Pushing the girl back harder) THERE IS NO TIME FOR THIS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> You know, I have Lieutenant Fury on my case about this &mdash; maybe we should talk to her? - she's around here somewhere&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">As Penny is about to open the door, all the lights go out. There is a long pause. The hospital's back-up generator does not kick in. Still no lights as the room is eerily quiet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Now what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> They're here and they're coming&hellip; FAST</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">At Ona Rosa's hospital bedside, Anita clutches her sister's cold, lifeless hand and sobs as monitors and machines barely blink and stir. Hector is behind her as Frank and Carmen sit on the opposite side of the bed and cry.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Oni&hellip; why?</p>

<div class="stage">Anita stares at the ligature marks around her neck as a ventilator pushes artificial breath into Ona Rosa's lungs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I don't understand&hellip; are those marks from her rosary beads?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> The nuns found her &mdash; they were on their way to evening prayers when&hellip; the rosary was around her neck</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen wails in anguish and runs into the bathroom to vomit. Frank hobbles after his wife to make sure she is okay.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Whispering to Hector) There's no hope, is there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> There is always hope&hellip; but the doctors say she is brain dead &mdash; no one knows how long she was without oxygen before the paramedics arrived &mdash; she has arrested three times already</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Wiping tears) Oh, God</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Stephanie is doing all she can, she has a call out to the best neurologist in LA &mdash; we'll know for sure when she hears from him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Where the FUCK is Javier?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I don't know &mdash; we left the kids with the neighbors &mdash; the university is doing their best to locate him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Tell 'em to try all the Motel 6's</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> 'NITA&hellip; not here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> WHY? &mdash; she can't hear me, she's a god damn turnip now!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> ANITA</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Maybe it's about TIME she hears what a lowlife cheating piece of shit her husband IS</p>

<div class="stage">Hector grabs his niece up out of the chair and forces her away from the bed.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (In her face) I know how upset you are but you need to STOP your mouth before I put my fist through it, CLARO?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Throwing his hands off of her) Go to hell</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen and Frank return from the bathroom. They pass by Anita as if she wasn't there.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Whimpering to her husband) They promised it wouldn't happen to her&hellip; they promised us!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Overhearing) PROMISED? &mdash; who promised? &mdash; what are you talking about?</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen is aghast as she realizes she spoke out loud.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Pulling her mother's arm) MAMI?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Pushing her away) Not now, Anita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> DO YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS TO HER?</p>

<div class="stage">Hector now rushes over and literally pushes Anita out of Ona Rosa's room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Take a walk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY SISTER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I said, TAKE A WALK, ANITA &mdash; come back when you can act like an adult</p>

<div class="stage">As Anita stumbles back into the hallway, she runs into KJ. He catches the last part of the conversation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Your sister? &mdash; did something happen to Ona Rosa?</p>

<div class="stage">Before Anita can answer, KJ brushes by her and Hector. He hurries into the room and can't believe his eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> God, OH GOD, NO &mdash; WHAT HAPPENED?</p>

<div class="stage">Anita glares directly at her uncle and then to her parents.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> ASK THEM</p>

<div class="stage">Anita now charges down the hall, past the waiting room, to the elevators. The lights suddenly go out. When everyone realizes the emergency power is not coming on, panic sets in. Doctors and nurses grab flashlights and scurry into patients' rooms.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Oh, God &mdash; Oni's machine!</p>

<div class="stage">As Anita heads back, she stumbles into Morrigan around the corner. McBride freezes in her tracks before the snarling lieutenant. The ambient light from the windows and the glowing trident reflect on both of their faces.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> YOU&hellip; ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, TOO?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan steps back and holds the trident in a defensive manner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Preparing to lunge) First, Father Greg, now my SISTER &mdash; quemadura en infierno!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan jumps aside as the hoods fly up the hall towards Anita.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Tell that to them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Turning around) Oh, shit</p>

<div class="stage">Anita ducks just in time as a hood sweeps down in her direction. Morrigan bats one away with the trident and it goes soaring up into a ceiling panel.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> JUST LET THEM GO BY, THEY'RE AFTER SOMETHING</p>

<div class="stage">Anita whips out her handgun and unloads into one of them.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y3c20_anita_shooting.jpg" alt="" h="399" w="533"  b="0">


<div class="stage">The blue hood sputters and collapses to the ground. Morrigan watches the others head down the hall towards Ona Rosa's room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Or someone&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">Before the hoods can reach the room, they are blown back a concussive wave. Darkfin rounds the corner with Penny following behind with her fingers in her ears. The wave only stuns the brown hoods. The other in blue grabs Darkfin by the throat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> SO NOT HAPPENING</p>

<div class="stage">The Renselier daughter bites the blue hood on the arm. The arm starts to smoke and releases its captor. Penny and Darkfin spin away before the hood explodes into flames.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Helping Darkfin to her feet) I'd hate to see what would happen if she had braces</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin snatches the trident from Morrigan and goes to work on the remaining hoods.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Leave some for me!</p>

<div class="stage">As Darkfin battles on, Morrigan and Penny stand guard at opposite ends of the hall. Anita crashes a glass case and plucks a fire extinguisher from the wall.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> TIME TO TAKE A POWDER</p>

<div class="stage">She empties the contents in the hood's face and then clobbers it on the head with the canister.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Time to see who exactly these fucktards are</p>

<div class="stage">Anita pulls back the blue hood and wipes away the powder and blood. She squints and holds up a pen light. She is shocked by the face staring back at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> JASON CLARK? &mdash; what the&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can finish, Jason leaps up with eyes aglow and sends Anita flying across the room. Before he can turn around, the trident bursts through his chest.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> One less problem</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y3c20_bye_jason.jpg" alt="" h="467" w="506"  b="0">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rushing over) JASON? &mdash; why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> CONCENTRATE, MORRIGAN, WE ARE NOT FINISHED</p>

<div class="stage">The last hood continues for Ona Rosa's room. Anita chases after it with a potted plant. She catches up to it, hurls the ceramic kitten vase and it shatters against the hood's back. As it turns around, Anita plucks up a large shard and is about to jam it into the hood's throat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Stepping between them) ANITA, NO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Tio?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> It has a job to do</p>

<div class="stage">Before Anita can react, Hector knocks her unconscious.</div>


<div class="stage">Across the way, Dr. Stephanie Gates is in the middle of treating her youngest granddaughter and several other emergency room patients.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Barking orders) I WANT ALL NON-CRITICAL CASES EVACUATED INTO THE PARKING LOT, ASAP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hannah</span> Ganni, I smell smoke</p>

<div class="stage">Stephanie peeks into the hall and stares at a hood on fire.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> KEEP IT FROM THE&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">Before Stephanie can finish her sentence, it crawls closer to a large oxygen tank. Darkfin sees what is about to happen and flings herself over Morrigan. Penelope lets loose with a blood-curdling scream as she ducks inside a room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Throwing herself over Hannah) Save us</p>

<div class="stage">A massive explosion rocks the entire hospital.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y3c20_hospital_boom.jpg" alt="" h="322" w="460"  b="0">

<hr>

<div class="stage">With the white robe covering his face and body, Turner arrives at an ultra-secluded resort on the edge of the Don Alessandro mountains. The private bungalow overlooks Duquesa Bay where the glow of the hospital fire can be seen in the distance. Outside on the patio, a woman dressed in the same white robe reclines on a chaise.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Bowing to her) It is nearly ready</p>

<div class="stage">The woman does not answer. She extends her hand for him to kiss it. As he does so, her coral-colored fingernails gleam against the darkness. Cinched around her waist is a helix-like chain loop belt made of Nereidium.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Playing with the belt) Our time is nearly here</p>

<div class="stage">The woman pulls the belt loose so her robe falls open to reveal her nude body. As Turner bends to admire it closer, she slings the chain around his neck and spins him into the iron fence. The bones in his arm snap like toothpicks as he slams against it.</div>
