<div class="stage">Swimming along the shoreline, Darkfin is too ill to make 
 it back to her lair at Concha Dos or even to her yacht at the Marina. 
 Her transmogrification is completely out of sync, causing her body even 
 more trauma.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Stumbling onto the sand) Too much... too much at one 
 time... I need to recalculate...</p>

<div class="stage">She tries to summon her trident but is too weak to do 
 so. Aleta Oscura throws herself behind some bushes and begins to dry 
 heave.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Looking around) This is Beacon Point but I cannot... go 
 home</p>

<div class="stage"> Aware of her half-morphed and oddly colored status, 
 Darkfin struggles to think for a moment as her head spins.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> But I can go... close</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Outside an abandoned farmhand house on the outskirts 
 of the Fiore property, Hector Tapia and Dr. Stephanie Gates pull up 
 in a van with blackened windows. Making sure that no one is around to 
 see them, they carefully unload a stretcher containing the gravely ill 
 Karl von Meer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Don't lose his IV!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Lifting the stretcher down) I see it, I see it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Packing up some equipment) Are you sure you still 
 have utilities for this place?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Only cold water from the pump but the electrical outlets should 
 be OK, if not, I can bring in a generator</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> A generator would cause too much noise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Pushing the stretcher along) Look, Stephi, it's not like 
 you gave me a lot of time to plan this out!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I know, I'm sorry - this was not what I had in mind 
 for my evening</p>

<div class="stage">The two are able to roll him up to the porch and then 
 carry the stretcher up the stairs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> What exactly happened to him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I'm not certain but I will move heaven and earth to 
 find out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Half smile) There's that one-track mind I know and love</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Raising an eyebrow) Now is not the time for that, 
 Hector</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> See what I mean? - tunnel vision, it's very sexy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> You know what would be sexy? - if you could get some 
 heat going in this place and spare me the double entendre</p>

<div class="stage">Hector goes about fixing a fire in the old wood-burning 
 stove as Dr. Stephanie checks Karl's vital signs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Taking the stethoscope out of her ears) At least his 
 blood pressure has stabilized</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Noticing the gray pallor of Karl Senior) This hombre was 
 never Mr. Fit 'n Trim but now he doesn't look good at all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Considering the amount of poison in his system, he 
 looks remarkably well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Shaking his head) Poison? - Christ... what kind?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I have a few theories - I'm still waiting for the lab 
 to call me back with conclusive results</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Why would someone want to poison Karl? - your asshole ex, 
 I can understand, but not Karl - he's the good kind of upper class!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> He's still a businessman worth over $300,000,000 - 
 it's not hard to be a target with that kind of wealth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> If this is paying the price, I'm happy being working class</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Griffin mentioned that there's some kind of major deal 
 in the works at Meeramar involving the PCOC</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Sly look) Really? - do you know what it's about?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I washed my hands of all that before the ink was dry 
 on the divorce documents but Griffin knows something, so I assume Ben, 
 Brad and Vicky are aware of it as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Stoking the fire in the stove) Huh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> What has me worried is what if this deal has something 
 to do with Karl's current condition? - are my children next?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm sure they'll be OK... ALL of them</p>

<div class="stage">Stephanie casts a glare a Hector.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Do you suspect someone in Karl's own family might have done 
 it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Ponders for a moment) No, I can't imagine it... but 
 it might be someone close to them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Could be... but it is pretty cruel of you to let his wife 
 and kids think he's dead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Looking out a window) It's the only way I know of 
 right now to keep him alive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I still don't understand why we couldn't have kept him hidden 
 somewhere at the hospital, you have a lot of loyal people there who 
 would've kept their mouths shut</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Squeezing Karl's fingers) It's a risk I am not willing 
 to take</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Watching her hand and becoming jealous) It seems to me like 
 you're willing to risk a lot for him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Sharply) DO YOU NOT WANT TO HELP US, HECTOR, IS THIS 
 TOO MUCH FOR YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Defensive) DO YOU THINK I'D BE DOING THIS IF I DIDN'T WANT 
 TO?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I don't know, WOULD YOU? - you're always the KING OF 
 THE ANGLES - WHAT IS IN IT FOR YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Folding his arms) WHAT IS IN IT FOR ME? - HOW ABOUT A RETURN 
 TRIP TO BURTEN PRISON IF I'M CAUGHT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (On the verge of tears) JUST... JUST GIVE ME A HALF 
 HOUR TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO TAKE HIM AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
 IT ANYMORE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Grabbing her arm) THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Snatching her arm away) WHAT DID YOU MEAN, HECTOR, 
 WHAT DID YOU MEAN?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Lowering his voice to barely above a whisper) That maybe 
 I want to do this without any angles, that maybe I want to do this for 
 you, to help you... and Karl... because I sincerely want to?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> There isn't a sincere bone in your body</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Evil grin) Yeah, there's one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Can't help but chuckle) I suppose you're going to 
 come up with a poem about it now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I could try for a limerick</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I've heard enough of your limericks for one lifetime... 
 and I've also heard enough of your lies - do you actually expect me 
 to trust you now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Of all the people to call tonight, you called ME, why?</p>

<div class="stage">Unable to come up with an answer, the solemn woman can 
 only look down at the dusty floor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Now standing by her side) I'll tell you why... despite all 
 of the history between us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> A history of blackmail and deception...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Despite ALL of that, I still love you... and I know you still 
 love me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Holding up her hand in protest) Let's not get into 
 this NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Taking her hand and holding it next to his heart) We share 
 something that goes beyond the two of us, something that validates my 
 existence no matter how flawed my existence may be</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. Stephanie is unable to hold back the tears and the 
 two of them seek comfort in each other with an embrace.
</div>
<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c02_steph-hector.jpg" h="456" w="510">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Quickly pulling back) I'm sorry... I'm overstressed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I can help out with that as well</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can answer, he bends in to kiss her. At first 
 reticent, but now unable to resist, Dr. Stephanie returns it with fervor. 
 Within seconds, Hector has her pinned up against a wall next to Karl 
 Senior's bedside and begins to make love to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (In halting breaths) If I let you do this... are we 
 even?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Completely freezing) FUCK YOU, STEPHI - I WAS DOING YOU A 
 FAVOR - I'll go see if I can find that generator</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Fixing herself) Please do!</p>

<div class="stage">Hector Tapia slams the door behind him. The loud noise 
 causes Karl Senior to open his eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> KARL... KARL, CAN YOU HEAR ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> HELP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I'M RIGHT HERE, KARL, WE'RE HELPING YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> HELP HER... HELP HER, STEPHANIE, SHE'S 
 IN DANGER</p>

<div class="stage">Outside the Martel mansion on Beacon Point, Griffin is 
 on his cell phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Still no signs of Erika? - don't worry, KJ, we'll find her, 
 I promise - hold on, I have another call coming through, it might be 
 her... RIKKA, IS THAT YOU? - hello, father - no, not yet - I'm at the 
 house... no, there doesn't appear to be any major damage from the quake, 
 just some plates and glasses - DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S A WISE MOVE 
 RIGHT NOW? - FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOUR BEST FRIEND AND BUSINESS PARTNER JUST 
 DIED A FEW HOURS AGO, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? - you know the board has 
 to vote on that - no, NO - WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS AFTER I FIND ERIKA - 
 END OF DISCUSSION</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin pitches the cell phone across the back lawn. 
 He suddenly takes notice of the boathouse in the distance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Running towards it) Of course! 
</p>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c02_griffin.jpg" h="510" w="445">

<div class="stage">Inside the boathouse, a completely changed Erika lies 
 naked in human form amongst a pile of towels and lifejackets. She is 
 shivering and sweating as Griffin bursts through the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Going over to her side) Why didn't I think of this sooner?</p>

<div class="stage">He gently stirs her from slumber.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Rik... Rikka, wake up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Eyes fluttering) Griffin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> This was always your favorite place to play hide 'n seek</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Still weak) What... what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You tell me - I find you cold and naked in here and, to put 
 it mildly, you smell like rotten fish!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I took a little swim</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I can see that</p>

<div class="stage">He suddenly turns away and becomes anxious.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sensing his mood) What's wrong?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Swallowing hard) You haven't heard yet, have you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sitting up) Heard what?</p>

 two hours...</p>

<div class="stage">He turns to look her in the eye.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Utter panic) OH NO, SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO MORRIGAN</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> GRIFFIN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Biting his lip) He... he died, Erika</p>

<div class="stage">Tossing and turning on her cot in the wine cellar, Morrigan 
 McBride continues to drift in and out of consciousness as her throbbing 
 foot has finally stopped bleeding. She dreams of her childhood and a 
 day spent picnicking with her then pregnant mother, Deirdre. A six-year-old 
 Morrigan runs through the grass and deliberately falls into a puddle 
 of mud next to some wild daises. She looks up and giggles at her mother 
 who is now joined by a robed priest. The two sit on a marble bench and 
 speak as Morrigan inches closer to hear what they are saying. She tries 
 to see the priest's face but is unable to do so because of the hood 
 covering it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> (Watching Morrigan) That's my little nature girl - give her 
 a field of flowers and she's content</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Priest</span> As it should be</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> (Now scowling) My husband likes to joke that we should plant 
 her ankle-deep in dirt under her favorite elm out back and see if she 
 grows</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Priest</span> That's an apt description</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> It's a description of a grave</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Priest</span> Not necessarily</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> Please don't patronize me, father - we know she has 
 one foot in it already</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Priest</span> Lower your voice, the child can hear you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> She's a smart girl, she senses it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Priest</span> It's not Morrigan's time yet - there is a lot ahead of her, 
 first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> (Holding her protruding stomach) I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Jumping up) MOMMIE, MOMMIE, WHY ARE YOUR EYES GLOWING?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> (Quickly putting her sunglasses on) They're not glowing, 
 Honey, it's a reflection from the sun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> PRETTY - OOH, LOOK AT THE BUGGERFLY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> That's a beautiful butterfly, isn't it, Mo?</p>

 mission that must be fulfilled... for all of us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> A mission she never signed up for - a mission I created for 
 her the second she was conceived - and, for that, I will never forgive 
 myself</p>

 could do to protect her - you can only try... and prepare her the best 
 you can for what lies ahead - the same you will do for your son when 
 he is born</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> How do you know it's going to be a boy?</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Priest</span> (Looking up at the sun) You wanted some time alone with her 
 before the baby is born - I suggest you enjoy the remains of the day</p>

<div class="stage">With that, the priest takes his leave. Morrigan watches 
 him from behind a rock and then runs over to her mother with a limp 
 and a closed fist.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> What happened to your foot?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I dunno, it kinda hurts</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> (Reaching) Let me see</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Stepping back) No, Mommie - look, I brought you a present</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deirdre</span> Really? - how thoughtful of you, what it is?</p>

 around for you... what happened? - WHAT? - NO, HOLY MOTHER OF GOD - 
 I'M SO SORRY, MY SON - I'LL BE OVER THERE AS SOON AS I CAN</p>

<div class="stage">Hanging up the phone, Joe falls to his knees and says 
 a silent prayer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Crossing himself and drying his tears) There's one thing I have 
 to do first...</p>

<div class="stage">Carrying some hot cider and a bowl of vegetable soup, 
 Joe makes his way down to the wine cellar without anyone noticing. He 
 sets the meal on a box beside Morrigan and covers her with another blanket. 
 As he turns to leave, the blood-curdling shriek from the young woman 
 causes him to jump.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Springing up) MOMMIE, MOMMIE, HELP ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Running over to her side and comforting her) Ms. McBride... 
 Morrigan, it's alright, it was just a bad dream</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Eyes darting around) Where... where am I? - what am I doing 
 here with you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Amethyst brought you here - don't worry, you're safe!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHERE DID AMY GO? - IF THE POLICE CATCH HER...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> She'll be fine - she has her father's instincts</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan looks at him for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> I brought you something to eat</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Realizing she's hungry) Thanks... I've heard good things 
 about your soup</p>

<div class="stage">Joe smiles but continues to look troubled.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Mr. Tiszo...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Joe, please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Joe... I also know what you were in your past</p>

<div class="stage">Joe becomes even more on edge.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I want you to know that I did NOT kill Father Greg, I swear 
 to you on my life - you have to believe me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> I do... if I didn't, I would not be providing you sanctuary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you - I'll be out of here as soon as I feel better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> NO, you must stay here - it is not safe for you out there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I've already placed Amy in jeopardy, I will not do the same 
 to you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Turning red in the face) There has been enough DAMAGE out there 
 tonight, I will not risk you becoming another victim!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT? - DEAR GOD, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN 
 TO ERIKA?</p>

<div class="stage">Both are stunned by the words.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I meant... KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> No - but their father...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHAT HAPPENED TO KARL?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> He... has passed on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> HE'S DEAD?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO - HOW?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> I'm not sure yet - I'm on my way over to the house</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting up) I'm going with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> OUT OF THE QUESTION</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pained expression) DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, I NEED TO BE THERE 
 FOR... I JUST NEED TO BE THERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF THE POLICE INTRUDING 
 ON THEIR TIME OF SORROW AND LOSS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I... suppose not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Stay here, stay well, and stay safe - I will return with more 
 news</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Slowly sitting back down on the cot) There has to be something 
 I can do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Making his way back up the stairs) You will</p>
