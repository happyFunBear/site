      <p>Griffin tries his best to sooth a preoccupied Erika. Penny has fun with both Jeremy and Brad. After a lively lunch at Muldoon's, Morrigan relaxes on a sunset hike with KJ in the Kiyomis and hears the legend of Duquesa Bay. After KJ takes off, Morrigan is now alone in the middle of a storm with a hooded figure. After giving chase, she finally comes face to face with Darkfin!</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Reading a book and using a compass) It's starting to make a little more sense now, this is definitely the sphere... ugh, this is NOT the time for a headache!</p>

<div class="stage">Sensing someone in back of her, she whips around to find a smiling Griffin dressed in his business suit with his shoes and socks off. He slowly sits down next to her and begins to rub her shoulders.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Let me help you with that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Not protesting) Thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking at the charts) Taking up astronomy now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's a simple diversion</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Intensifying his technique) There are others, you know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Turning to him) So, how goes the PR battle with &quot;The Maleeva?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Losing the mood) It's being handled</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm sure father is thrilled with KJ's involvement</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> What involvement?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Exactly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You run circles around your brother when it comes to business sense, we could always use your input</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Alright... stop using the ships to run illegal guns</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Taken aback) We had no idea that was happening!</p>

<div class="stage">The von Meer daughter tosses him a look and returns to her book.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Listen, why don't we go grab some lunch?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm not that hungry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Dinner later?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> If I say maybe, will you leave me alone?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Only if it's an honest maybe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Damn - seriously, tomorrow night would be better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Great, I'll make reservations - where would you like to go?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You pick... as long as it's not seafood</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Getting up) I'll pick you up at 7:00</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Goodbye, Rif</p>

<div class="stage">Later that afternoon inside Muldoon's, Gracie and Morrigan chat over lunch as Lieutenant Fiore, with guitar in hand, sets up for her evening gig.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Going over to the two and smiling) Hello girls, do you have any requests?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I suppose Fatboy Slim is out of your range</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have a request... tell me everything you know about what happened on the Maleeva</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Walking away) Heh, if you want some Stevie Nicks, let me know</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan and Gracie smirk at each other as the lieutenant returns to the small stage area.</div>

</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Picking at some of Gracie's fries) I have to say, that editing job you did on our piece yesterday was brilliant!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Of course, what else would it be?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Turning serious) Have you heard anymore from your source on the train wreck tape?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Equally as serious) No, and that's starting to worry me - I've left several messages for him</p>

<div class="stage">Anita's raucous laughter causes them to turn in her direction.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Turning back to Morrigan) No new leads on what really went down on that ship?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still observing Anita) Not yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why don't you try KJ for some inside scoop?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I could but I KNOW Fiore is hiding something and so is Phelps - it's just a matter of cracking their eggs at some point</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> HA, that's some image - thankfully, not enough to ruin my appetite</p>

<div class="stage">Zach saunters in and heads for their table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Reading his shirt) Well, that's about to change</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (All smiles) Ladies</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie scans his black shirt with white lettering - &quot;I only listen to the voices in my pants.&quot;</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y1c20_zach_smiling.jpg" h="491" w="183"  b="0" a="center">
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Like the shirt?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Tell me, does one of them sound like a foghorn?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Laughing) Ouch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Not bad, not bad - whoa, look at all the lickity chicks lining up for the lieutenant, has she even sung yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> If you call it singing... no</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Still eyeing Anita's groupies) I hope she's considerate enough to bring home a leftover for Captain Crunch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, he needs to get over her sister... her married sister</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Raising an eyebrow) So does KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Are you going to help him with that, Morri?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not sure yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I think I'll grab a beer, do you two want one?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> In the middle of the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Yep</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I know, I just had to say it - bring me back a light draft</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> M&amp;M?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No thanks, I still have my iced tea</p>

<div class="stage">The two watch the Daily Beacon reporter amble up to the bar.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking at her watch) Speaking of KJ, I need to meet him in a little bit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Where are you two going?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> He's taking me for a &quot;sunset hike&quot; in the Kiyomis</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> OOH, major make-out place... according to Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Actually, I am more interested in the background of the area - I have a strange feeling about it and I don't know why</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Aw, not more funky dreams again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> McBride, you're sad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Well, you better get going soon, there's a storm due tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Really?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Ya know, it would be wise if you watched your own newscast - sure, Austin can be annoying at times but he's very accurate when it comes to the weather... and it's supposed to be pissing buckets later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Throwing her napkin on the table) Great!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Returning) I heard the word &quot;piss&quot; - what did I miss?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Jumping up) All of this talk has inspired me, I'll be right back</p>

<div class="stage">As she enters the bathroom and selects the lesser of two evil stalls, her cell phone begins to ring.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes?</p>

<div class="stage">The somber voice of Justine Mirabello is heard.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Hello, Morrigan - I just wanted to let you know that, to my UTTER AMAZEMENT, the test results your SCU contact did are 100% valid</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself) Nice job, Tim</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> And thanks for dinner the other night at Le Petite Bistro</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I appreciate you taking the time to confirm these findings</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Please be sure to tell Zach how much I ENJOYED Le Petite Bistro and how I wouldn't mind dining there again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, no problem</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> On a serious note, you seem like a good person... I don't want you to end up as my job</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> These results frighten me and, you can ask Zach, it takes A LOT to frighten me... science can explain 90% of what's out there and explain it relatively well, but there's 10% we cannot even touch yet and this falls directly into that category</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can you even call it a category?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> We can't touch it, we're not even close to touching it and I, quite frankly, don't want to touch anything that touches it, understand?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Unfortunately, I do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Why don't you go back to investigating defective teddy bears or something?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can't, I'm more curious than ever now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Normally, I would be too, but something in my gut - which I RARELY RARELY listen to anymore - is doing backflips</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you sure it's not the frog legs from Le Petite Bistro?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Oh, and one final thing - which I'm sure will come as no surprise to you... the bodies from the Maleeva all share similar characteristics to the museum victims, as well as the Celeso Beach boys</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sighing) Thanks, goodbye Justine</p>

<div class="stage">Walking home from school and taking the long way through the cemetery by the sea, Penny and Jeremy share an apple and a kiss. They sit under a huge marble monument with a majestic angel looking down on them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Nibbling Penny's nose) Are we cool again?</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y1c20_penny_standing.jpg" h="493" w="200"  b="0" a="center">
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Holding his hand) For now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I'm really sorry about not being there for you at the museum</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Forget about it and move on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> How's your mom doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Still trying to play superwoman - how's your mom?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Doing the same</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Looks around at the tombstones) &quot;Beloved wife and mother&quot; - is that all we're supposed to be?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I see just as many &quot;beloved husband and father&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Yeah, but you also see &quot;honorable soldier,&quot; &quot;community leader,&quot; &quot;esteemed inventor&quot;... I want mine to read &quot;feared businesswoman and creature of the night&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> First, you need to pass high school</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Flopping backwards on the ground) Not you, too - what do I need stupid school for? - I have a genius IQ, not to mention my family's fortune and business connections</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> What if your family cut you off? - then what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Sitting back up and grinning) My family would NEVER cut me off - I hold a massive guilt leash around both of their necks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Scoffing) Well, you'll never fully appreciate the joys of the real world until you choose between paying the gas or the electric bill</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Going into her purse and pulling out some money) Here, Merry Christmas</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Scowling) It's not Christmas</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> OK, Happy Ramadan then - whatever, just take the fucking money!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I don't say these things for you to give me charity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> It's NOT charity... it's a gift</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> That helps!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Look, I don't need it, my family sure as hell doesn't need it - and if this amount means your family gets both gas and electricity for a month, then who are you to be offended?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Begrudgingly taking it) Fine</p>

<div class="stage">In his black mini-truck, Brad slowly drives by the cemetery gate and honks at them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Shouting out of his window) Hey Pen, are you going to the Iron Party tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Holding Jeremy's hand up) Yes, WE are going to the Iron Party tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Why don't you try hanging out with people your own age, old man?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Why don't you try owning a real ride, baby boy - by the way, LOVE those fuzzy orange pants... very masculine!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> SCREW OFF, BRADLEY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Driving away) ONLY IF YOU'LL HELP ME, PENELOPE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Getting up) C'mon, Jere, let's go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> He's stalking you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Don't be dramatic</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Admit it, you like Brad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I DO NOT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Yeah, you do!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> He totally repulses me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> People can be attracted to and repulsed by someone at the same time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I'll admit to liking Brad if you'll admit to liking Gracie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Unnerved) GRACIE? - dude, she's my friend and music mentor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Uh-huh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Knock it off</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Make me</p>

<div class="stage">The two begin to tickle and kiss each other. The Renselier daughter suddenly spots Erika running across the sands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Taking off after her) There's Rikka, I got to go tell her thanks for trying to help me with my classes - I'll see you later at the party?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Heading in the opposite direction) For sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> You better not bail on me this time!</p>

<div class="stage">As Penny reaches the sand, Erika has disappeared from her sight.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Scanning around) ERIKA... HEY ERIKA, WHERE DID YOU GO?</p>

<div class="stage">After she walks along the beach for a few minutes, she stumbles across a pile of Erika's clothes and books hidden behind a dune.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Picking up her shirt) This really odd</p>

<div class="stage">She suddenly feels a presence in back of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Turning around) Did you decide to go for a swim au natural?</p>

<div class="stage">A grinning Brad winks at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Not yet but I could be convinced</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> AW MAN, GET LOST</p>

<div class="stage">He slowly approaches her, saying nothing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I'm looking for Erika - have you seen her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Glancing at the discarded clothes) No, but I sure wouldn't mind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Pig</p>

<div class="stage">He grabs a hold of Penny and kisses her hard.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Semi-resisting) OW... your stubble hurts</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I thought you fetish chicks like that kind of thing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I'm not into fetishes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Pulling her into an embrace) So, you're a poser?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Allowing herself to be felt up by him) Hardly</p>

<div class="stage">The two resume kissing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Every place is a make-out place for Isaacson</p>

<div class="stage">The two share a small laugh.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> According to legend, it was also a make-out place for Ernesto and Leticia</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Baffled) Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> You've been here all of this time and you don't know the legend of Duquesa Bay? - and you call yourself a journalist!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I've been a little busy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> True</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Give me the Cliff's Notes version</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Leticia Maria Cabrera del Aragon was a duchess and blood relative to the King of Spain - she was married off to the best admiral in the fleet, Bernardo Martinez - he was also a huge asshole</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Every good story needs an asshole or two</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> He cheated on her, physically abused her, and used her family's money for his own gain - well, one of his business ventures was a gold mine out here in the nueva territories - because he traveled so much, he wanted to make sure his investment was protected - no one would dare harm a duchess, let alone a relative of the king, so he forced Leticia to leave her family and live out here in their hacienda</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Bad Bernardo!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Leticia was even more miserable than before but found solace in the mission - it was there that she met Padre Ernesto</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The forbidden love interest, ooh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> They enjoyed teaching the natives as well as rutting like rabbits - Bernardo eventually found out about it and hunted down Ernesto</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Dramatic) Duh duh DUH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> May I continue?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> By all means</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> The admiral beheaded the monk-no-more and rowed a clueless Leticia out into the middle of the bay under the pretense of giving her a special gift</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why can't men give gifts without strings attached?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Would you like a breath mint?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> There is a string attached there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Hee hee, anyway - he opened the sack and pulled out a dazzling pearl necklace and placed it around her neck - he then pulled out the head of her lover and forced her to hold it while he shot three holes in the bottom of the boat and swam off</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's just wrong</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> The duchess couldn't swim, the boat slowly sank, and she drowned - the people on shore said they could hear her wailing for Ernesto and praying for mercy for hours - weeks later, they found what was left of Leticia's body on Celoso Beach, the necklace still around her neck... the skull of Ernesto has yet to be recovered</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What about Bernardo?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> That's another story for another time - now, you either found this really horrific or really romantic... which one?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) Both, I suppose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Bending in to kiss her) Stick with the romantic side right now, please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Returning the kiss) Alright</p>

<div class="stage">The two continue to kiss as a light rain begins to fall.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Stopping and looking up) Wait a minute, I didn't even see these clouds on the horizon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Getting up and putting his jacket over her) It's rolling in from the southeast, let's get out of here before it really opens up</p>

<div class="stage">The two trot quickly back to their cars in the parking area. KJ's pager goes off as the rain comes down harder.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Sheepish) Um, I'm sorry but I need to take off - Ona Rosa wants me in on this deposition she's doing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Can we meet up later?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm actually a little tired</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Getting into his car) How about tomorrow night then?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll give you a call and let you know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Aren't you taking off?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> In a minute, I need to get some brochures from the park ranger</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> OK, I'll see you... I had a great time, Morri!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Watching him drive off) Yeah</p>

<div class="stage">The storm intensifies as she walks up to an information kiosk and then returns to her car with a few pamphlets. An uneasiness envelops Morrigan as the hairs on the back of her neck begin to prickle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not again</p>

<div class="stage">She frantically rummages through her glove compartment and grabs a hold of a flashlight.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> DAMMIT - I forgot to get my freaking gun back from the CHP</p>

<div class="stage">Emptying everything out of her backpack and purse, Morrigan finds her Swiss Army Knife and opens the tiny blade.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh yes, this will do the trick - stay back or I'll stab you... or open a wine bottle and clip your nails!</p>

<div class="stage">Now totally dark outside with rain coming down in sheets, Morrigan debates whether to investigate the eeriness or just start up the engine and leave. As she reaches for the keys, a hooded figure stands before her car and beckons to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Gasping) OH MY GOD... what do I do?</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, the figure floats off into the bushes. Morrigan reluctantly gets out of the car and follows with her flashlight and knife firmly in hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm insane, I'm insane, I'm insane</p>

<div class="stage">Upon reaching the mouth of a cave, the brunette inhales deeply and clenches her teeth. Suddenly, her flashlight begins to fade.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's it, I'm going back!</p>

<div class="stage">As she turns around, Darkfin stands directly before her, eyes blazing in front of her face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> There is no going back</p>
