      <h1>Year 1, Chapter 1: Tell Me A Story</h1>
      <p>Driving up the coast to her new KCON reporting job, Morrigan McBride experiences mysterious car trouble and breaks down on the outskirts of town. She is forced to spend the night in her car by the side of the road. 

The next morning, only more problems ensue as she meets up with her idiosyncratic field producer/camerawoman, Gracie Takanachi, and is forced to go to work early, covering Duquesa Bay's latest multiple homicide.</p>

<div class="stage">Driving along a lone highway, parallel to the Pacific Ocean,
    <a href="../people.html#morrigan">Morrigan McBride</a> sings along to the radio in between bites of a cheeseburger.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan McBride</span> &quot;... Caribbean Queen, now we're sharing the same dream, and our hearts they'll beat as
    one, no more love on the run&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, the white, late model Mustang she's driving blows the left back tire, causing the U-Haul trailer behind it to fishtail.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Swerving into a ditch on the side of the road) No God, not again!</p>

<div class="stage">After a few moments, the young woman finds that she is unharmed, collects herself, and gets out to check the damage.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Kicking the car door) This is payback for me singing 80's songs, isn't it?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan brushes the remainder of the burger off of her shirt as she first reaches into her purse to pull out a cell phone
    and then into the glove compartment to pull out a gun.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (On the phone) Hi Nancy, sorry to wake you, can you please put Dad on the line?... Hello, Dad... no,
    I'm fine, everything's okay... well, maybe not... I ran off the road... Dad, DAD, PLEASE CALM DOWN, I'M FINE, REALLY...
    no, it's not that serious, just a little annoying</p>

<div class="stage">The still somewhat shaken woman walks around the car a few times.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> As far as I can tell, I have a few problems... one: the tire... two: the ditch... three: I think the
    axle is shot on the trailer - oh, and I... uh... I kind of took the scenic route</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan holds the phone away from her ear for a second.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Dad, PLEASE... I don't need this from you now - I've been driving for five hours since I left your place
    - it's after two in the morning and I'm only about 45 minutes away from Santa Conchita... no, I can't call the Auto Club,
    I've used up all of my times this year</p>

<div class="stage">Again, she holds the phone away from her, rolls her eyes and sighs.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting back into the car) Listen, Dad, this is what I'm going to do... I'm locking myself in the car
    with the cell phone and Grandma's Smith &amp; Wesson - after I get a quick nap, I'll fix the tire, unhitch the U-Haul
    and then get out of here, I promise - everything will be fine... I'm not a little girl anymore, I can handle this...
    Dad, GOODNIGHT DAD</p>

<div class="stage">Shaking her head and taking a deep breath, she turns off her phone.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking off) It's during times like these that I really miss you, Mom</p>

<div class="stage">She now pulls out her laptop and opens a file titled &quot;Daily Journal.&quot;</div>

    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Typing)</p>

                <b>Friday</b> - Well, I'm off to a wonderful start in my new city... actually, I'm not in my new city YET... I'm in a ditch
                on the side of the road, right next to the Pacific Ocean. After spending the last two days of driving through Southwestern
                Hell, I finally made it back home to crazy California. I visited with Dad and Nancy for the day -- he looks the same,
                I think she had her boobs done. Little Caitlin showed me her collection of plastic horses -- I'm still not used to being
                a &quot;big sister&quot; again. The thought of eating Nancy's vegan lasagna was the reason why I left Carlsbad so early.
                It's more than obvious now that the wiser decision would've been to stay the night. Anyway, here I am, exhausted, reeking
                of cheeseburger and car interior. Dad offered to change my tires before I drove up here but I wanted to wait -- GREAT
                IDEA, MORRIGAN -- at least I don't have to start at the station until next week.

<div class="stage">A wave of shivers rolls over the woman as she looks towards the sea.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Talking to herself) Hmm, that's odd... the fog is thickening so fast, I can barely see around me...
    so, why does it feel like I'm being watched?</p>

<div class="stage">Her laptop suddenly loses power.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Banging on it) C'MON, I know I have another 45 minutes of charge!</p>

<div class="stage">She checks her cell phone to find that it, too, has lost all power.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What is up with this?</p>

<div class="stage">As she tries starting her car to no avail, the tiny hairs on the back of her arms and neck prick up.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying not to panic) Okay... I'm not scuffing my socks on a shag carpet... I'm not rubbing a balloon
    up and down my arm... I'm not cold... WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?</p>

<div class="stage">The young woman locks the doors and slumps down in her seat, gripping the gun more tightly.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Peering out the window) This is the part where space aliens come and abduct me, I know it!</p>

<div class="stage">All is quiet around her.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's funny, I'm... I'm not really afraid... in fact, I feel oddly calm</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan sighs and rubs her forehead.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, maybe if I tell myself that enough times, I'll believe it</p>

<div class="stage">The fog starts to lift slightly.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sitting up again) STOP IT, STOP IT - this is probably some kind of weird fog/weather anomaly type thing,
    that's all - I'm just psyching myself out like I used to do with that stupid &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; game we played at
    Julie's slumber parties</p>

<div class="stage">Yawning and realizing she is absolutely exhausted, the young woman reclines her seat back.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still gripping the gun) The only thing left to do now is to go to sleep and leave it to The Fates</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan closes her eyes.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> PLEASE NO AXE MURDERERS, PLEASE NO AXE MURDERERS, PLEASE NO AXE MURDERERS, AMEN</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">As dawn breaks, it is still somewhat foggy outside. Morrigan opens her eyes to see a large, bald man holding a tire iron
    staring back at her through the window.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing her gun and screaming) BACK OFF OR I'LL SHOOT</p>

<div class="stage">A California Highway Patrol officer appears from the other side of the car with his gun drawn.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">CHP</span> PUT THE GUN DOWN, MA'AM, PUT IT DOWN</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHAT IS GOING ON?</p>

<div class="stage">
    <a href="../people.html#gracie">Gracie Takanachi</a> runs over.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie Takanachi</span> CHILL, CHILL, EVERYBODY JUST CHILL</p>

<img   b="0" h="250" w="209" src="assets/images/gracie_headshot.gif" a="center"/>


<div class="stage">With the officer watching, Morrigan carefully places her gun on the passenger seat and slowly gets out of the car.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (All smiles) Hi there, I'm Gracie Takanachi from KCON, your supreme field producer and camerawoman, this
    charming man to your left is Lloyd the tow truck driver, and the man pointing a gun at your head is Officer Baten - how
    are you doing this morning?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Bewildered) I... uh... I'm so sorry... I just saw Lloyd's face... and... I was half asleep... how...
    how did you know where to find me?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">CHP</span> (Putting his gun away) Your father called us, Ms. McBride, he was very concerned about his little girl</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nice</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> And when I heard the report on the scanner, I knew who you were and followed</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks for calling the tow truck</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and the officer look at each other.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Neither one of us called</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Lloyd</span> (Starting to work on the tire) It was some lady who called me, said she'd take care of the bill as well</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Did she leave a name?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Lloyd</span> Nope</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Huh</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Don't worry, you'll find out soon enough - people in this town don't do favors for someone without a price</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The tire should be easy to fix but I think the axle is broken on my trailer and there's something freaky
    going on with my electrical system</p>

<div class="stage">The tall, bald man checks under the hood.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Lloyd</span> No kidding, your battery is drained</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How is that possible? - I just bought it last month</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Lloyd</span> It also looks like some of your circuitry is fried</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan shakes her head in disbelief.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Lloyd</span> (Shrugging his shoulders and closing the hood) Towing your car out of here won't be a problem but I'll
    have to come back for the trailer, it's pretty screwed</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Wonderful</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Lloyd</span> I can call for another truck</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at Morrigan) Forget that - this is already going to cost you a week's worth of salary</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">CHP</span> Traffic is going to pick up here shortly, these vehicles need to be moved</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I know, KJ lives right down the road from here - we can drag it to his yard on the way</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Way?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Writing on a slip of paper) Lloyd, please take the car to this mechanic - Officer Baten, if that's all...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">CHP</span> Actually, I'll need to keep Ms. McBride's weapon until she gets herself settled - you can claim it later</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Of course, officer, I understand, thank you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">CHP</span> (Taking off with the gun) You can thank your Dad, he's a well-respected lawman in this state</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, I know</p>

<div class="stage">Lloyd hitches up the damaged U-Haul in back of Gracie's big, brown news van. As the tow truck driver takes off with Morrigan's
    car, both women climb inside the van and buckle up.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying not to stare at Gracie's right hand) Thanks for all of your help</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Noticing) You're welcome... now, I'm giving you five seconds to get over the fact that I'm missing two
    fingers - five... four... three... WHOOPS, can't count to two and one!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Please forgive me, I didn't mean to offend you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Starting the engine) There's nothing to forgive and as far as offending me goes, it takes plenty more
    than that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know this sounds rude - call it journalist's curiosity - but what happened?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Driving) You're right, it is rude but I can't blame you for being curious - you wouldn't have won all
    of those journalism awards if you weren't</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You do your research</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I wouldn't be in this business if I didn't</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie stops the car and pretends to get all emotional.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> It... it was... a family vacation at Busch Gardens gone horribly horribly wrong!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Really?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> No... piranhas</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> C'mon!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Okay - when I was six, my brother accidentally caught my fingers in the car door - snapped the last two
    right off</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yeesh</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> But I always get great birthday presents from my brother</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Couldn't you save them?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I wanted to but they wouldn't let me - dipped in gold leaf, they'd make unique earrings, don't you think?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I MEANT, couldn't the doctors save your fingers?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Back then, I lived in a small town outside of Seattle, by the time my family took me to the big city hospital,
    it was too late to save them... end of story</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I like the Busch Gardens version better</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, so does everyone else</p>

<div class="stage">The two exchange smiles.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> My Mom is just grateful that is was my RIGHT hand so I can technically still wear a wedding ring</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And you can still use your middle finger to flip off people when necessary</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Winking) Now, what makes you think I'd ever do that?</p>

<div class="stage">The van stops outside of long, gated driveway. Morrigan looks up past the trees and spots a three-story Tudor mansion at
    the end of it.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh my God!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (On her cell phone) Hey KJ, it's Gracie - when you wake your ass up, come get the present I left outside
    - I'll explain later... thanks!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I've seen this house before</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous?&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> YES</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> The one with Sophia Loren and that Arab sheik guy?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> YES</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> We're pathetic!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> YES</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Getting out and untying the trailer) Give me a hand - or should I say two more fingers with this, Morgan</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Joining her) Morrigan</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> What exactly is the difference?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> &quot;Morgen&quot; is German for &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;Morrigan&quot; is the Celtic Goddess
    of War</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Guess what? - I'm now calling you &quot;Morri&quot; it's simpler - hand me that wrench, MORRI</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Doing so) So, who's KJ?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Karl John von Meer - one of the few rich people I don't resent - he's a real sweetheart and good-looking,
    too</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is there a &quot;Mrs. KJ?&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Nah, he's too busy playing the field, meadow, glen and just about everything else to settle down</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ah</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Of course the woman that finally nabs him will become a part of the von Meer shipping dynasty - and don't
    think that fact hasn't escaped every breathing female in the county</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's kinda sad</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> What's really sad is his science geek sister,
    <a href="../people.html#erika">Erika</a> - she could be a freaking supermodel but she buries herself in beakers and books at Santa Conchita University</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is she a student?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> HA, she's a Ph.D..</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Good for her</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> We'll probably have to interview Rikka or one of the other SCUBA department heads later for the story.</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Story?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking down at her watch) SHIT - we have 37 minutes to air - LET'S GO</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO START UNTIL NEXT WEEK</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> More than driftwood washed up on Celoso Beach this morning... the bodies of three men were found a little
    bit ago</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Drownings?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Uh... no... not if they're like before - and my sources say they are</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking out a notepad) Before?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Over the last year, we've had a half dozen bodies turn up around the Duquesa Bay area - this will make
    it seven, eight, and nine - the Coast Guard and the local police have tried to keep it as hush-hush as possible and the
    people in the area don't care... in fact, they cheer</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Cheer?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> It looks like vigilante justice - all of the victims were doing something illegal at the time - dumping
    medical waste, smuggling drugs, etc.</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The station manager never mentioned any recent murders when he hired me</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Surprise! - grab that manila folder in back with the pizza stain on it - inside is all the backstory you'll
    need to do the piece</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Flipping through) What happened to the regular field reporter?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Kylee is off banging the network execs for the weekend and our sports reporter fill-in is in bed with
    a broken ankle - we knew you were arriving in town today, so you're on, Babe!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yay</p>

    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Secondly, you have ketchup all over your shirt - Smurfette looks like she's on the rag - murder or no

    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sheepishly putting it on) Agreed</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Claudia, at approximately six o'clock this morning, the bodies of three local men were discovered on
    the southern shore of Celoso Beach by a Coast Guard patrol unit -- although it appears that the men drowned, officials
    have not confirmed the cause of death and declined further comment -- family members of the victims will be notified
    shortly -- according to area residents, there were no signs of a disturbance during the night or in the early morning
    hours, however, because of dense fog, no one can say for sure -- since April of last year, six other bodies have been
    found on area beaches, ranging from Chaparral Heights to Beacon Point -- whether these three are related has yet to be
    determined -- officials from the Coast Guard, along with the Quartz County Sheriff, will be holding a joint press conference
    later this evening, you can be certain we'll have more details on this tragedy for you then -- as for Celoso Beach, it
    will remain closed until further notice... Morrigan McBride, KCON NewsCenter 8</p>
