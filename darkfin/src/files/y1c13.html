<div class="stage">Inside the von Meer estate, Erika ruminates on her recent events as Darkfin while her fingers glide casually over the keys
  of a grand piano. Out of the corner, a cloaked figure in an iron, vulpine mask softly approaches from behind.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Not looking at him) You're early, Griffin</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> Should I be flattered that you always know when I enter a room?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Continuing to play) Try toning down your cologne</p>

<img  b="0" h="237" w="192" src="assets/images/griffin_headshot.gif" a="center"/>


<div class="stage">Lifting his mask, the most handsome of the Martel brothers curls one side of his mouth into a grin and takes a seat on the
  piano bench.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> As much as I enjoy Palestrina's &quot;Lamentation,&quot; we're going to be late unless...</p>

<div class="stage">He looks disparagingly at her cut-off shorts and SCU sweatshirt.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> You plan on going as a homeless person or a California native</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Slowing her hand movements) What's the matter, Rif, don't you want to be fashionably late?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> Late, yes - miss half of the event, no - but, if you have something better for us to do in mind, I am more
  than willing to accommodate</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rising) I'm afraid you'll have to accommodate yourself tonight, I'm not going</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Trying to subdue his anger) What, another whale to save?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> For once, it has nothing to do with my work... MOTHER</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> THEN, WHAT?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't feel well</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Feeling her cheek) Surely you can come up with something better than that</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> It's my time of the month</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, Griffin grabs Erika's waist, bends his head and inhales deeply between her legs.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> Funny, there's no scent of this</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Pushing him back) YOU PIG</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> And pigs have a brilliant sense of smell... and what I smell is another lie - tell me, what are you REALLY
  doing tonight, my love?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Anything but you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Trying a new tactic) Lydia and Penny will be so disappointed if you don't come</p>

<div class="stage">His words give pause to Erika as Karl Senior and Pauline von Meer enter the room dressed like Louis the XVI and Mary Antoinette.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Turning to them) My lord and lady, might I implore you to convince your fair daughter here to grace us
  with her presence and attend tonight's festivities... TO HELP THOSE IN NEED?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Who is the one in need, Griffin?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Rushing over and grabbing her daughter by the ear) FOR GODSSAKES, ERIKA, THIS IS THE PREMIER CHARITY EVENT
  OF THE SEASON - WE HAVE A FAMILY NAME TO UPHOLD</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Family name or social standing?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Tightening her grip) GRIFFY AND I AGONIZED OVER PICKING OUT THE BEST COSTUME FOR YOU</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I feel your pain</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> MOVE YOUR ASS, GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE BEFORE I GIVE YOU A REAL REASON TO STAY HOME</p>

<div class="stage">The tall, blonde woman glares at her shorter mother and then to her father who looks at the floor.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> It is for charity, honey - besides, it's not like we all go out as a family every night</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Heading up the stairs) I wonder why</p>

<div class="stage">She is met half way by KJ coming down the stairs as Superman.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Leaping to the bottom) DA DA DA - it's a bird... no, it's a plane...</p>

<img  b="0" h="112" w="150" src="assets/images/y1c13_supes.gif" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> YOU LOOK LIKE A FAGGOT, GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Kissing his mother on the cheek) And you look like a heartless bitch, even without the costume</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> KJ</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Still watching from the staircase) You are more than welcome to use mine</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> As much as dressing in drag would thrill our sweet mother, I need to keep this theme since my date will be going
  as Lois Lane</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Rolling her eyes) Oh, God</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Thinking for a second) Ms. McBride is still your date?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Yes - you sound surprised?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Resuming her course to her room) I am... I thought she had better taste</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking at his watch) Not that I don't enjoy the von Meer family bonding moments, but we all need to get
  going ASAP before the good caviar disappears</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sighing) I'll be ready in five minutes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Rushing out the door) UP, UP, AND AWAY</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Leaning on her husband's shoulder) It would have been easier breeding Weimaraners</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Patting her back) But not as much fun</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">At the Santa Conchita Lanes, Gracie and Zach enjoy a fine evening of &quot;Disco Bowling&quot; with their friends. As the
  lights twinkle around them and 70's dance songs blare from the sound system, Gracie takes a seat on the bench and stares
  at her shoes.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Grooving over to her) MORE MORE MORE, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? - 7/10 SPLIT, BABY, LET'S SEE

  <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Watching them) Are you upset because Half keeps making eyes at Joenne?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's not bothering me... too much - I'm just pissed, that's all</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> Pissed about what?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking him in the eye) Aren't you pissed?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> ABOUT WHAT?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> We've busted our asses in town for years and Morri is here less than a month and SHE gets to go to the ball?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> I can't believe I'm hearing this - you're jealous of THAT?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> NOT jealous... pissed</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> You mean to tell me you would rather be there with a bunch of dressed-up snobs instead of here eating stale
  nachos, drinking warm beer, and sharing the company of moi?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie says nothing.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> OF MOI? - Fingers, I'm hurt!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> And I'm still pissed - I'm tired of being the &quot;Nobody of Duquesa Bay&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> That's not true... you're the eight-fingered &quot;Nobody of Duquesa Bay&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">Justine Mirabello scores another strike.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Justine</span> ZACHARY, GET OVER HERE, IT'S YOUR TURN</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Ignoring her) Look, the only reason M&amp;M got invited is because KJ wants to impress her and get her into
  bed, that's it</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I feel a little better</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> Thought so - AND, I told him she was going as Lois Lane</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Evil grin) You ruined her surprise, that's mean!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> Well, I couldn't take the chance of him going as &quot;Spiderman&quot; - that would've been WRONG</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Justine</span> ZACH, NOW</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Pulling Gracie's hand) C'mon, I can't deal with Justine's gloat-fest if she wins - move those boogie shoes
  and let's kick her ass!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> How about I buy you another round of warm beer instead?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> That might work just as well</p>

<div class="stage">At her house, Morrigan puts the finishing touches on her hair and slips on the fake glasses. She admires herself in the mirror
  and then looks to a picture frame on her vanity that is wrapped with her rosary beads. It holds the image of her grandmother
  with her mother as a young girl.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan McBride</span> (Fingering it) I miss you two</p>

<div class="stage">A familiar knock is heard at the door.</div>

  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> My friends say I don't scream very well</p>

  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> YAY</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What brought this topic of conversation up?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> We were discussing the Chilean farming industry</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Of course you were</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> WOW - you look really good, Morrigan - I still would prefer to see you in one of those expensive, elaborate
  gowns but that suit totally works!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks, I hope this doesn't sound rude but do you mind keeping Roshumba and Amber outside? - this color
  is a cat hair magnet</p>

<div class="stage">The slightly plump woman with the pixie face holds up the smoky, long-haired cat.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (East African accent) You, Ms. McBride, should be honored to carry my hair with you to your little soiree
  tonight - BUT, in deference to the woman who feeds me, I shall grant your request</p>

<div class="stage">She places the cat outside and picks up the orange and white shorthair.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Squeaky voice) From what I've heard about KJ, my hair on your suit will seem like a blessing compared
  to other stuff</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I appreciate it, Amy</p>

<div class="stage">There is silence on the other end.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is anyone there?</p>

<div class="stage">A deep, eerie, male voice finally comes on.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Voice</span>The shattered water made a misty din,
  <br> Great waves looked over others coming in,
  <br> And thought of doing something to the shore
  <br> That water never did to land before</p>


<div class="stage">The phone clicks off as Morrigan turns five shades of pale.</div>

  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Noticing) What's wrong?</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> What poem is that from?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's what I'm looking for - the caller only recited the first few lines</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Sitting down) It came true!</p>

  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pausing) What are you talking about?</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What is Ansuz?</p>

  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> It's the message rune - you need to be aware of meetings with people, both arranged and those that happen
  by chance!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> GIMME A BREAK</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I'm trying to give you a warning</p>

  <span class="actor">KJ</span> The latter</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Roses are red, violets are blue...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm serious</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> So am I - since I went to a private college, I didn't have to take any General Education classes for my degree
  - the little poetry I did learn in school left my brain the second the semester ended, why?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking his arm) Just curious - let's go!</p>

<div class="stage">At the Quartz County Museum, people bedecked in all sorts of elegant costumes begin to arrive. They are met by tight security
  and escorted to the Etruscan Antiquities Hall, the main chamber for the event. Lydia Renselier, dressed as a flapper, is

  <span class="actor">Doug</span> (Looking at his watch) You go ahead, I need to give my regards to a business associate</p>

<div class="stage">As the guests mingle about the room, a shadowy figure runs across the museum rooftop and enters an air conditioning duct.
  Morrigan and KJ arrive at the ball, shortly followed by the von Meers, Griffin and Erika.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> This is pretty cool!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still preoccupied with the phone call) Yeah</p>

<div class="stage">They proceed to the main room and start to mix.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Aside to her husband) She looks ridiculous in that suit - is Ms. McBride too poor to afford a real costume?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Overhearing) Actually, I think she's the best dressed here</p>

<img  b="0" h="287" w="189" src="assets/images/y1c13_erika_gown.gif" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Scowling) KJ could've bought her something better</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> You're unhappy when a woman takes our son's money and now you're upset when one doesn't - let's get some
  champagne
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> I'll go get some for all of us!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Thank you, Griffy</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I'll just have some water, please</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Erika, the alcohol might do you some good</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia and George come over to them.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Shaking his hand) George, how's Sacramento?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">George</span> Flat and dry, with a lot of hot air... politics as usual!</p>

<div class="stage">They all fake laugh.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Giving Lydia a hug) Honey, you should be so proud - this is a FABULOUS party you threw together - I'm
  able-bodied and I couldn't have done all of this!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Smiling meekly) What my mother means is... NICE JOB</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Winking) I know, Rikka - I'm really glad you made it, we never get to see you anymore</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I've been busy</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> If you figure out with what, please let me know</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> Penelope has been asking for her favorite fish lady</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I'll be sure to say hi</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> She's probably hiding in the bathroom</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking off) Smart girl</p>

<div class="stage">On the way, Erika is suddenly stopped by the site of the Duquesa's Tears in a massive glass display case, surrounded by security
  guards. She peers closer at the three-strand choker of white and black pearls, held together by an emerald centerpiece.
  The seemingly silver clasp is what really has her attention. In the reflection of the glass, she detects the furtive glances
  exchanged by the guards.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Coming up behind his date with the champagne) It's pretty but I can have a necklace made for you that's
  10 times more beautiful</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking the drink) You know I'm not into jewelry</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> If you stare at this piece any harder, you'll shatter the protective case</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Sipping) Hmm... remember that time in boarding school when we accidentally broke the window in that Belgian
  cathedral?
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Slight laugh) Not one of our finer moments</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes, it was</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> Is that a smile?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> It's the alcohol</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> Then, by all means, let me fetch you some more!</p>

<div class="stage">After circulating around the room several times and meeting Santa Conchita Valley's society members, Morrigan and KJ retire
  to their own little corner by a marble pillar.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have to say, I'm having a wonderful time tonight, KJ, thank you for inviting me</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> It is my pleasure - everyone you've met is absolutely taken with you... as am I</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Deliberately ignoring the last comment) Well, when they weren't referring to me as &quot;that dog lady
  on the news,&quot; it was nice</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> We don't get a lot of heroes around here</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia and George wave and start to make their way towards them.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Actually, I take that back, here comes one now</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I bet she hates being called that</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> She does but it's true</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Kissing KJ) Sweetie, I'm so happy you're here and THANK YOU for that most generous contribution</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Hey, no problem - and I know it's going to a good cause!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">George</span> (Taking Morrigan's hand and squeezing it) Ms. McBride - I see you're making your way around town</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Raising an eyebrow at the assemblyman) I enjoyed our interview the other day</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">George</span> It was mutually beneficial</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You have a real presence before the camera, as well as, a wonderful way with words</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> How do you think he got elected?</p>

<div class="stage">All four fake laugh.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Mrs. Renselier, I am deeply impressed with this museum, I understand you are the driving force behind
  it all?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Pretending to be modest while George shakes his head) Well, I don't know about driving force, but it is
  my passion, that's for sure</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Glancing at Mr. Renselier out of the corner of her eye) I find the sculpture garden to be the most enchanting
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">George</span> I absolutely agree, it is my favorite area, too</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Losing the smile on her face) Come, George, let's leave these two young ones in peace, we have to say a
  few words to the Braemars before they leave</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">George</span> Of course</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> KJ, it was so nice to see ALL of the von Meers here tonight</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> It will probably be another year before that happens</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> Ms. McBride, keep up the good work at KCON</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It was great meeting you, Mrs. Renselier</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Watching them walk away) It's not fair, George has all that hair at his age and mine is starting to recede
  already
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Something clicks in her head) You're a very handsome man, KJ, with or without... hair... hairy</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (All smiles) Ya think?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span>The clouds were low and hairy in the skies
  <br> Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Huh?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> DAMMIT, DAMMIT, HOW DOES THE REST OF IT GO?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Leaning against the pillar) Are you okay?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry, I'm just being weird - let's go get some more of those delicious crab cakes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Lead the way!</p>

<div class="stage">As they start to walk, his cape catches the lighting sconce on the pillar.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Here, let me get that for you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Thanks, Lois</p>

<div class="stage">As she unhooks the cape, a tiny, square piece of metal with circuitry falls to the ground.</div>


<img  b="0" h="174" w="260" src="assets/images/y1c13_circuit.gif"/>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Looking around) I didn't break it!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Picking it up and examining it) Relax, Superman</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> If I did break it, I'll pay for it</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Checking out the sconce) I don't think it has anything to do with the light - it's not the same material
  and I can't find a place it would've fallen out of</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Then, toss it in the trash and let's go get those crab cakes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still looking at the square) It has to have some kind of purpose</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Does everything have to have a purpose with you?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Without missing a beat) Yes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Ooh, Ona Rosa finally made it - let's go say hey</p>

<hr>


<div class="stage">In a small corridor leading to the restrooms way on the other side of the building, Penny Renselier dries her tearstained
  eyes with a rough paper towel and takes out a cigarette.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Struggling with her lighter) Fuck you, Jere</p>

<div class="stage">Wearing leather chaps and dressed as a sheriff from the Old West, Bradley Martel ambles out of the bathroom, spots Penny
  and makes his way over to her.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Striking a match against his face and lighting her cigarette) You're too young to be smoking</p>

<img  b="0" h="89" w="81" src="assets/images/y1c13_sherif.gif" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Exhaling smoke at him) And you're too old to notice... Uncle Brad</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Taking her cigarette and smoking it) You're adopted, we're not blood</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Grabbing her cigarette back) So you keep reminding me</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> If you don't surrender... your cigarette... I'm going to have to arrest you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trying to burn him with it) You'd like that, wouldn't you?</p>

<div class="stage">The younger Martel brother knocks it away, pulls out a pair of handcuffs and slowly rubs them across her lips. She snags
  them out of his hand and chucks them across the room.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> Go pick them up</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> Make me</p>

<div class="stage">Brad slowly uses his body to push her up against the wall. Not resisting, she allows him to feel her up.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Breathing heavily into her ear) Where's your boyfriend?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Looking off into the distance) Not here</p>

<div class="stage">The two kiss wildly for a few moments.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Stopping him) If the concept of incest doesn't freak you out, how about statutory rape?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Fondling her breasts) I've been in jail for worse</p>

<div class="stage">He takes her hand and guides it between his legs.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> Nice gun, Cowboy</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> Pull the trigger... I dare you</p>

<div class="stage">With one, swift move, the Renselier daughter knees him in the groin, sending Brad backwards to the floor.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> Bang</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Struggling to his feet and trying to catch his breath) You... little bitch... I'm going to nail you for that
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Lifting up her skirt) Nail it to the wall, babe... if you can</p>

<div class="stage">Before Brad can reach Penny, Erika comes from around the corner and steps in front of him.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Bradley - it seems your brother Griffin is in need of entertainment this evening - why don't the two of you
  go off and play with yourselves?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Still looking at Penny) Rikka, what a surprise - you actually left the lab</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Getting in his face) Leave... now</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Hobbling off) I'll catch you later, Dragonfly!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> No, you won't</p>

<div class="stage">The girl gives Erika a huge hug.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> Glad you're here, Erika</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Still watching Brad) I'm sure you are</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> Ah, I could've handled him</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> You're playing a very dangerous game, Penelope</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Taking Erika's mask and holding it to her face) It's my game to play</p>

<div class="stage">Two guards walk by, look them over, and continue on.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Following them with her eyes) Tell me, is your mother using a different security force tonight?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> How the hell should I know?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Did you not help her with the arrangements?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> I suppose - I think the Mayor of Barcelona brought his own detail... why?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Just curious</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> Since you're the only other person I know that's here that doesn't want to be here, could you please bust
  me out of this nightmare?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Your parents are here and I don't want you out alone with Brad wandering around</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> Come with me to Vesper's house, you can help us with our math homework!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> That actually sounds like fun but I need to check something out</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Disappointed) Fine</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I'll tell you what, go back to the Etruscan Hall, STAY AWAY FROM BRAD, and I'll drive you to Vesper's in
  about 20 minutes</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> COOL, THANKS</p>

<div class="stage">Erika takes a deep breath and scans the rooms as she follows Penny back to the party. She runs into Captain Phelps and Lieutenant
  Fiore on the way.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Craig, it's a pleasant surprise to see you here</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> I could say the same thing, Dr. von Meer</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> With our jobs, I suppose we don't get to socialize that much</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> True</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Barely acknowledging Anita) Lieutenant</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Smiling at a cocktail waitress) Yeah, hi</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> I was wondering, Captain, do you know any of the security guards here tonight?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> No, I don't see any of my guys or extras from the sheriff's department - why?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> No real reason - have a good evening</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Nodding) Dr. von Meer</p>

<div class="stage">He watches her walk away as the cocktail waitress returns Anita's smile.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> I wonder what that was about?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Licking her lips) What? - I wasn't paying attention to what she said</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Noticing the cocktail waitress) I thought you wanted to leave after an hour?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Watching the woman slowly make her way towards her) I found a reason to stay</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Looking over to Ona Rosa) I don't know which one looks more stunning tonight, Erika or your sister?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> Jesus, between you and KJ drooling all over her, why don't you ask Oni out back and take turns doing her
  on the steps? - she would be appalled, at first, but then she'd get off on the attention of two REAL men</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> Don't talk about your sister like that!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> Why? - she's not a fucking saint... well, maybe she is but I don't have to bow down to her, that's your fantasy
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Sizing up the cocktail waitress) And that's yours?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> She's bringing me oysters, what's MRS. SANCHEZ bringing you?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> Funny, I would think you'd be crazy over the leggy blonde that just spoke to us?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Still watching the cocktail waitress) Erika von Meer is not just an iceberg, she's the entire continent
  of Antarctica and, as big of a blowtorch as I am, I know when to save fuel</p>

<div class="stage">The cocktail waitress is now directly in front of them.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> Especially when there are tastier marshmallows to torch - later, Matey!</p>

<div class="stage">The captain watches the two women leave and returns his attention to Ona Rosa. Mrs. Sanchez, dressed as a Native American
  shamaness, is surrounded by KJ, Morrigan, and her conquistador-clad husband, Javier.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> I swear, if it weren't for Ona Rosa's advice, I'd still be in the courthouse right now</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> You flatter me, Kage, the truth is this case had a lot of loop holes to close and we both found ways to
  close them in time</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking at his watch) How nice</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Dr. Sanchez...</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> Please, call me Sandy</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sandy... sand</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Ignoring him) You could not tell, and yet it looked as if
  <br> The sand was lucky in being backed by cliff
  <br> The cliff in being backed by continent</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Forgive me - what I meant to say was THANK YOU for your expertise on my sample from the other day</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> I take it the results were to your satisfaction?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Glaring at him) Mr. Hajanian was MOST helpful</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> Glad we could be of service</p>

<div class="stage">Anita passes by and smiles at all of them as she leaves with the cocktail waitress.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Scoffing) Lieutenant Fiore is some piece of work</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Yes, my sister inspires that reaction in a lot of people</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> At least she inspires something</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'M SO SORRY, I forgot you two were related</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Still stung by her husband's comment) That's alright - KJ would you mind introducing me to your new law
  partner?
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> Sure thing</p>

<div class="stage">The two leave.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> If you'll excuse me, Ms. McBride, I need to speak to the university president and her husband</p>

<div class="stage">Left alone, Morrigan tries to remember the rest of the poem in her head when she spots two security guards looking at their
  watches at the same time and then checking another lighting sconce like the one the metal square fell out of earlier.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Something is definitely not right here!</p>

<div class="stage">She reaches for her cell phone and remembers that all electronic devices had to be checked with security before anyone could
  proceed to the hall. This causes her to run out of the room with Erika noticing.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Following) What is our intrepid reporter up to now?</p>

<div class="stage">The Lois Lane look-alike stops at the security table with long line ahead of her.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> EXCUSE ME, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I GET A PHONE, COULD SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME?</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone ignores her except for the one, nasty comment of &quot;wait your goddamn turn, lady.&quot;</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Lowering her mask) Is there a problem, Ms. McBride</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Dr. von Meer - you wouldn't happen to have a phone, would you?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> No... but there is one in Lydia's office, I'll go get the key from her</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO, there's no time for that - just show me where her office is and I can get in</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Fascinated) Follow me</p>

<div class="stage">As the two hurry up the stairs, Morrigan unwittingly speaks the lines of the poem out loud.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> May I ask why you're reciting Robert Frost?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing Erika by the shoulders and almost losing her balance) YOU KNOW THAT POEM?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes, &quot;Once By The Pacific&quot; - why?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Her voice strained) HOW DOES IT GO, HOW DOES IT GO?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Clearing her throat)

  <br>The shattered water made a misty din,
  <br> Great waves looked over others coming in,
  <br> And thought of doing something to the shore
  <br> That water never did to land before
  <br> The clouds were low and hairy in the skies
  <br> Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes.
  <br> You could not tell, and yet it looked as if
  <br> The sand was lucky in being backed by cliff,
  <br> The cliff in being backed by continent.
  <br> It looked as if a night of dark intent
  <br> Was coming, and not only a night, an age.
  <br> Someone had better be prepared for rage.
  <br> There would be more than ocean water broken
  <br> Before God's last
  <br> Put out the light was spoken.
</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sweating) WHERE IS HER OFFICE?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Erika</span> First door on the right</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan runs over, and with a few items from her purse, picks the lock open in seconds.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing the phone and dialing) C'mon, Gracie, ANSWER</p>

<div class="stage">Erika stays outside the door and listens.</div>


<div class="stage">At the Techtonic Nightclub, Gracie is in the middle of a set when her phone vibrates.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Barely able to hear over the music) WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING ME?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> GRACIE, YOU'VE GOT TO GET ZACH AND GET OVER HERE, RIGHT NOW</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Going over to a somewhat quieter corner) Morrigan, is that you? - what's the matter, not making any new
  friends? - at least try to establish some potential sources</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> DAMMIT, GRACIE, LISTEN TO ME</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> WHAT'S WRONG?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I... I don't know... SOMETHING... something is very wrong here</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> You're not making any sense</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Some creepy guy called earlier and read me an ominous Robert Frost poem, then I found this strange metal
  square and the security guards are making me very uneasy</p>

<div class="stage">With those words, Erika bolts out of the building.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm telling you Gracie, something is going down here tonight, I'm not sure what</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Look, take a deep breath, lay off the champagne and think for a minute</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I am NOT drunk</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'm not saying you are</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Remember my green hand dreams?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Growing concerned) Did you have another one?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, but it's that same feeling of dread - I can't explain it - PLEASE GET OVER HERE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Okay, give me a few minutes to find a replacement DJ, drag Zach out of Justine's mouth and then we'll be
  right over</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Hanging up the phone) Thank you</p>

<div class="stage">She returns to the hall.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Dr. von Meer, I appreciate... Dr. von Meer?</p>

<div class="stage">Not far from the museum, Erika rips off her costume and dives into the ocean. As Darkfin, she returns to the party and is
  stopped by one of the guards before entering.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Guard</span> And what are you supposed to be, Neptune's whore?</p>

<img  b="0" h="252" w="207" src="assets/images/y1c13_df_face.jpg" a="center"/>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Snapping his neck with one twist) For you, the Angel of Death</p>

<div class="stage">After disposing of the guard's lifeless body behind some bushes, Darkfin passes through the door, checks to make sure no
  one else is around and then scales the wall.</div>


<div class="stage">Morrigan paces in the Native American section and suddenly freezes at one of the dioramas.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking around) I just saw a shadow move, I know I did!</p>

<div class="stage">KJ suddenly enters the room, causing Morrigan to scream.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> HEY, HEY HEY, IT'S JUST ME</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Shaking) SHIT, KJ, I'm sorry</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Holding her) What's the matter?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can we go back to the main room, PLEASE?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Bewildered) Sure, let's go</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe Gracie's right, I think I had too much to drink</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">KJ</span> I can take you home if you'd like?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Locking her eyes on the necklace) Shh, Lydia and the mayor are about to present the Duquesa's Tears</p>

<div class="stage">In the eaves of the ceiling, Darkfin locks her eyes on Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Approaching the podium) Ladies and gentlemen, this has been such an exciting evening, I want to thank you
  for...
</p>

<div class="stage">All of the sudden, every light in the museum goes out, followed by a large crash and people screaming.</div>
