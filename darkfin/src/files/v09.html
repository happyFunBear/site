<div class="stage">Flying back to Duquesa Bay in his private jet, Douglas Martel, the co-CEO of Meeramar shipping, discusses his recent board meeting in San Diego with his associates over a conference call.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Gentlemen, I was quite pleased with the 4th quarter report - I don't see any reason for apprehension - we're on schedule as far as I'm concerned - my son, Griffin, is spearheading this project and I have full faith in his ability to get it done - we'll discuss it more in depth over lunch next week - Bert, good luck with your polyps and Fletcher, let me know what happens in Phoenix... talk to you later, 'bye</p>

<div class="stage">He hangs up and dials his son.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Griff, it's dad - listen, I'm on my way back now - I BETTER see some spectacular reports from you - I just sold a bill of goods to Bert and Fletcher, YOU need to come through and back this up, big time, son - 'CAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD ANYMORE FUCK-UPS, YOU FUCK THIS UP, I FUCK YOU UP, it's that simple - see you at the office</p>

<div class="stage">He hangs up and quickly peruses the sports page of his newspaper. Now dialing the manager of his baseball farm club, &quot;The Cactus,&quot; Douglas blows his nose into a blue linen handkerchief and clears his throat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Hey, Billy, how's it going? - I see we won the last three games, that's great - tell me, what's the status of the first baseman? - and what did the MRI show? - ooh, that's not good, not good at all - there's no way they'll ever repair that to perfection, we're talking long rehab here and he's just not worth the effort - find a way to cut him loose - nope, sorry, he's damaged goods now, we have other cheaper talent waiting in the wings - his wife just had twins? - how nice, be sure to send him a gift basket with two of everything - then find a loophole in his contract and send him packing! - I'll be at the game tomorrow afternoon, make sure the cheerleaders do that little dance I like</p>

<div class="stage">As he hangs up from that call, another one comes through from his personal secretary.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> What's up, Phyllis? - oh, her birthday's next week? - just pick out an expensive bracelet and fill her chambers with purple flowers - hmm, or is her favorite color yellow? - hell, just fill it up with yellow and purple flowers - thanks, and have the cargo reports waiting on my desk - I'll be there in an hour</p>

<div class="stage">Once again, he hangs up. This time, he dials his daughter, Victoria Martel.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Vikki, it's daddy - someone's birthday is coming up soon - on Wednesday? - THURSDAY, THURSDAY, I knew that - anyway, pick out a decent restaurant, something I KNOW you can do with aplomb, and we'll go - fabulous, oh, and give me the number of your law school buddy in the 5th circuit - 'bye, Sweetie!</p>

<div class="stage">As he reclines in his leather seat, an attractive bottle-blonde flight attendant struts over and serves him some coffee. Doug smiles and enjoys the view as she hands him a file.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Flight Attendant</span> If I may be so bold, Mr. Martel, I'd like to leave my photos and resume with you - if there are ANY extra roles on &quot;Sigma 7,&quot; I'd do anything for the opportunity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Thumbing through the photos) Very nice headshots... and other shots as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Flight Attendant</span> (Smirking) For your pleasure</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/v09_photos.jpg" h="268" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Picking up a copy of &quot;Variety&quot;) Actually, Honey, you just reminded me of something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Flight Attendant</span> (Squeezing his knee) Something good, I hope</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Frowning at the trade paper) Eh, not quite - now, if you'll excuse me, I need to make a call</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Flight Attendant</span> (Seductive look) If you need anything else, I'll be in the lavatory</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Winking) I'll see what I can do for you about a walk-on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Flight Attendant</span> (Closing the door behind her) My numbers are on the resume</p>

<div class="stage">Doug dials the other executive producer of his show, &quot;Sigma 7.&quot;</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Andy, what's the story? - uh-huh, well, I'm looking at the ratings here and they're stagnant, we're doing well but we're being creamed by a game show, A FUCKING GAME SHOW, ANDY - and DON'T even get me started on Regis - we need to do something, QUICKLY, to broaden the audience base - NATPE is coming up soon and we need to go in there with something that will knock their socks off - I don't give a rat's ass about the loyal audience, they'll tune in if we have Ursula reading out of a phone book - what's on board for sweeps? - no, no, I don't like that idea at all - it's too intellectual, we need something risky that will get a lot of press - forget Jessie, she's not in charge, this is no longer her show, it's OURS, please remind her of that fact - as for the Marcy problem, I have no clue about what to do - the audience freaking adores her, she skews across the board - I know, I know, she needs to do publicity for the show, no matter how much she despises it - look, Andy, I don't care if we stick her in a white lace wedding dress while she simultaneously sucks off six dicks, it still won't make her seem straight because MARCY NOLAN IS NOT STRAIGHT - she knows it, the camera knows it, all of America and some mid-eastern countries know it but no one has the balls to admit it - God forbid this former &quot;Teen Sweetheart&quot; be anything but a happy hetero - look, we've TRIED with every possible male love interest, dark, blond, tall, short, fat, thin, old, young, white, black - hell, we even tried a one-legged guy - NO CHEMISTRY, yet she even so much as glances at a female extra and we've got crotch fluid, I'm talking Niagara Falls here - NO, we've tried that, if she sticks her tongue down his throat any further, it's going to be coming out of his ass!</p>

<div class="stage">The jet's pilot speaks over the intercom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pilot</span> Mr. Martel, you wanted me to let you know when we were ready to land?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Thanks, Jim, I want to take this tin bird in myself, I'll be there in five</p>

<div class="stage">He retruns to his call.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> We'll discuss all this later, Andy - also, I have a sky whore here who needs a part, see what you can do - ciao!</p>

<div class="stage">Douglas Martel places one final phone call.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Exceedingly serious) Have you found out anymore about my wife's new lover? - I expect results by the end of the week and they better be on videotape - look, I don't care who it is, I want this matter taken care of ASAP, do you understand? - I will NOT be played for a fool!</p>

<div class="stage">He slams down the phone and stares out the window at the city below him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> He's a dead man, Ursi, enjoy him while you can</p>
