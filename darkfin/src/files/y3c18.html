<div class="stage">Hannah's parents and others watch in terror as the little girl slides over the side of the ship. Erika dives over after her. She catches Hannah in mid-air, curls her own body around the child to shield her against the impact of the water.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (To herself) Hold on</p>

<div class="stage">Splash! The force of the water and the awkward angle knock the wind out of Erika. She is paralyzed in the water as Hannah flails to the surface, kicking and screaming. Erika starts to sink as the Darkfin morph takes over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hannah</span> (Choking) Mommy!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> (Rushing towards the side) NO</p>

<div class="stage">Craig tackles Claudia before she can go over. Ben holds their two other screaming children in his arms.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> I HAVE TO GET HER, LET ME GO</p>

<div class="stage">Craig motions to two crewmen to keep a hold of Claudia. He throws a life jacket on himself and takes another for the girl.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Kicking off his shoes) I'll get her, I promise!</p>

<div class="stage">Craig now goes over the side but the ferocity of the storm and the surging waves make it difficult to see.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Now in the water) HANNAH &mdash; HANNAH</p>

<div class="stage">The ship lists again. Craig is caught in the current and slammed up against its side. He is knocked out but the vest keeps his head above water. Hannah succumbs to the cold turbulence around her. The body of the unconscious girl sinks down below the surface. Although Erika is now Darkfin, she is unable to get her bearings and flashes back to a time in Sri Lanka.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> Remember, Erika &mdash; we are only testing your breathing abilities today &mdash; no heroics</p>

<div class="stage">It's a bright, sunny day and the water is a blue-jewel color. Erika is stretched out on the sailboat in a bikini. She yawns as Heavy Metal music blares from the stereo.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> (Snapping it off) Are you listening to me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Yeah, yeah &mdash; let me know when we get to the site</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> This is a very crucial point in our research &mdash; if your lungs have not adapted, all else fails</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Chill, Sam &mdash; everything else has gone swimmingly, heh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> So far</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Always the optimist</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> In science, you prepare for every possible outcome</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> So that's why you have the crash cart below deck?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> (Trying not to show her nervousness) It is simply a precaution</p>

<div class="stage">Erika picks up on Samadara's mood and goes over to her mentor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rubbing her shoulders) Listen, I ran and reran the simulations all week &mdash; nothing but green lights</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> (Sighing) I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking her hand) Samadara &mdash; I'm not worried &mdash; and if something does happen, you'll be right there for me... I couldn't be in better hands</p>

<div class="stage">Samadara smiles and squeezes her hand. The smile quickly fades as she spots a marker buoy in the water.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> We're here</p>

<div class="stage">After setting up some monitoring equipment, Samadara helps Erika with an emergency air tank and regulator.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> You are to be down there for 20 minutes and 20 minutes only</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Setting her watch) Right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> (Tipping her head up to meet hers) I'm not kidding, Erika &mdash; not one second over!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Alright, already, I heard you!</p>

<div class="stage">Erika positions herself on the side of the boat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> Whatever happens, do not panic &mdash; go inside yourself &mdash; remember the meditation and breathing techniques I taught you</p>

<div class="stage">Erika rolls her eyes, waves to Samadara, and plunges into the sea. For a few seconds, Erika is hesitant but then inhales deeply. The seawater stings her nasal passages and she starts to gag and cough. Trying not to panic, she recalls Samadara's words and takes, slow, measured breaths.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (To herself) Just breathe</p>

<div class="stage">Regaining control, Erika realizes that she is indeed breathing underwater on her own.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I can do this, I can do this...</p>

<div class="stage">Erika laughs underwater as she starts to swim deeper. Minutes go by as she follows a sea turtle. Next, she darts around with a school of fish. Erika loses complete track of time.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm a mermaid without the annoying fish tail or Disney tunes, this is awesome!</p>

<div class="stage">Now underwater for over 30 minutes, Erika suddenly blacks out. Moments later, she wakes up with the breathing mask around her face and in Samadara's arms. Dr. Ranasinghe gently swims to the surface with her apprentice in tow. Erika struggles a bit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> Relax and inhale</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm trying but I feel like I'm choking</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> That's because you are &mdash; focus on me and take slow sips of air</p>

<div class="stage">They make it back to the sailboat. Samadara hoists Erika on deck and continues to minister to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> Your color is coming back &mdash; feeling better?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Slightly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> GOOD, BECAUSE NOW I CAN YELL AT YOU FOR BEING IRRESPONSIBLE AND STUPID</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I think I'm getting sick again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> This is not an amusing little game for a little girl to play &mdash; do you not understand the consequences of it all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Too much so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> Then start behaving like a scientist and not a spoiled brat!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Sam...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> (Pacing) What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I was breathing underwater</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. Ranasinghe pauses and looks at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Half smile) No gills, no air tanks, I... was breathing under water!</p>

<div class="stage">Samadara now shares her smile. Erika struggles to her feet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> You were, weren't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Hugging her) WE DID IT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> (Returning the embrace) No, you did it, Erika &mdash; it was all you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I couldn't have done it without you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> True enough</p>

<div class="stage">The two giggle with giddiness.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> Next, we will need more modifications besides your lungs in order for your human body to withstand the rigors of the sea</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Frowning) Does this mean I get a fish tail?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Samadara</span> Um, not quite...</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin snaps out of her state when a seal playfully bumps her foot. She spots the body of little Hannah floating towards her. She grabs the girl up in her arms and carries her to the surface. The sea still rages around them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Please, Hannah, come on &mdash; breathe!</p>

<div class="stage">As she blows air into the lungs of Ben and Claudia's daughter, she notices the unconscious Craig bobbing by in the water. She swims over to him and rips off his life vest and pants. She places the vest around Hannah and fastens the child to Craig by shredding the pants with her armfin and binding them both with the strips.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Time to get you both back on deck...</p>

<div class="stage">A deep rumbling sound is heard as the ship continues to take on water.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> As long as it does not sink before I get to it...</p>

<div class="stage">A bolt of lightning cracks from the clouds and singes the side of the ship.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Or before we fry</p>

<div class="stage">With Craig and the girl under one arm, Darkfin carefully begins to scale the stern. A fuel leak in the surrounding water makes it extremely difficult for her hand and feet suckers to stick on the slick metal.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y3c18_df_hannah.jpg" alt="" h="510" w="577"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> This is not productive</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin uses all her strength to shimmy up as much as she can but then slides back down a bit. She continues to do this until they finally near the top.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Getting dizzy) Just... a few feet... more</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can slip again, a hand reaches down and grabs a hold of Craig's arm. Darkfin looks up and stares at a glowing-eyed Penny Renselier. Neither one of them says a word as Penny hauls Craig up and takes Hannah in her arms. The voice of a crewman calls out.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y3c18_penny_eyes.jpg" alt="" h="479" w="471"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> MISS &mdash; MISS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?</p>

<div class="stage">Penny turns around as Darkfin does a quick backflip into the water.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> HOLD ON, I'M GETTING HELP</p>

<div class="stage">With Craig and Hannah now safe, Darkfin turns her attention to the gash in the ship. She swims underneath to take a look.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Inspecting the hole in the hull) This was not made by conventional explosives</p>

<div class="stage">She swims in a circle, trying to decide the best way to help. The ship only has a few more minutes before it sinks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Bowing her head) I hope they will help</p>

<div class="stage">After a brief moment of meditation, Darkfin calls upon her rarely used sonar skills to reach a pod of orcas. One swims over to her and they communicate. After a long silence, the rest appear.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> No, I will not have you do this - there must be another way</p>

<div class="stage">The oldest whale brushes by her and sacrifices itself by plugging up the gash in the ship with its body. The jagged metal rips into its flesh. Warm blood floods the frigid waters. A chorus of keens and clicks echoes throughout.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I am so very sorry but thank you for your gift - I will forever be in your debt</p>

<div class="stage">Another orca indicates to her that if the ship did sink and break apart, the resulting oil spill would be a hazard to them all.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Checking the ship) The water has slowed... it is working</p>

<div class="stage">The sounds of another ship are heard. It is the signature of a USCG vessel. Help has finally arrived.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> About time</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, all of the orcas scatter quickly in different directions.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> WAIT &mdash; there is nothing to be afraid of, it is only a Coast Guard vessel!</p>

<div class="stage">There is no response. The water around Darkfin dramatically increases in temperature.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> What now?</p>

<div class="stage">Five large multi-colored lights surround Darkfin and head straight for her.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">With the shades drawn and no lights on in her house, Morrigan huddles on the sofa and reads a text message from Darkfin on her secret account.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It sure doesn't feel like all is well</p>

<div class="stage">Now listening to the approaching storm, Morrigan ponders as a lone candle flickers dimly next to her tarantula's terrarium.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Analyzing the rainfall patterns) Something is off, Tallulah... very off</p>

<div class="stage">A crack of lightning explodes directly over the house. Morrigan grabs her marked foot and screams.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> They're after her!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan bolts out of her house and into the yard. She slams directly into Amy who is unloading groceries from her car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Tumbling backwards and dropping a bag) MORRIGAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT TO STOP THEM</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> WHO?</p>

<div class="stage">Amy frantically scans around and shoves an empty grocery bag over Morrigan's head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Are you crazy? &mdash; we can't let anyone see you out here &mdash; get back in the house!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Throwing off the bag) IF YOU DON'T DRIVE ME, I'LL RUN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> FINE, FINE, GET IN THE CAR</p>

<div class="stage">They do so and speed off. Minutes later, Morrigan sobs into her hands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Can... can you tell me what's happening?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan can only gasp.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I don't understand, I would have been made aware of my Father's plans</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Shaking) They got her... they already got her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Staring out the window) Ona Rosa</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's too late &mdash; GET ME TO THE BEACH</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Along with three other USCG rescue vessels, Anita approaches the Meeramar tanker. They are unable to establish communication with the ship.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I don't know how we're gonna reach everyone with all this chop</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> There's some kind of strange EM interference going on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> The storm?</p>

<div class="stage">All of the power abruptly goes out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> (Trying not to panic) I think it's underwater</p>

<div class="stage">All of the ships now take on a dull blue glow.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> What is this, St. Elmo's Fire?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> It wouldn't be covering the entire ship...</p>

<div class="stage">Anita and the others check the water as a slow hissing sound is heard.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Or beneath the surface &mdash; LET'S GET THOSE PEOPLE AND THEN GET OUTTA HERE PRONTO</p>

<div class="stage">The battle between Darkfin and the five mysterious lights rages below. Each one takes a pass and slams directly into her. They're too fast, too powerful. Badly battered and bruised, Darkfin starts to lose consciousness. All of the sudden, her trident appears and she starts bashing the lights like helpless pi&ntilde;atas. They retreat and disappear.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Regarding the orange glow of her weapon) You heard me</p>

<div class="stage">Before blacking out, Darkfin wraps both hands tightly around the trident. The rest of her body goes limp but the suckers on her palms keep her anchored to the trident. The glow fades but it moves quickly through the water, towing its master with it. Almost instantly, everything is calm again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking at the clearing skies) Are the rest of you seeing this?</p>

<div class="stage">The crew nods in silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I have no idea what the hell is going on or how long it's going to last &mdash; let's start moving those people, c'mon!</p>

<div class="stage">Within minutes, they link up with the Meeramar tanker and start evacuating the passengers. Anita searches the ship and finds the unconscious Craig in the corner with Ursula. Ben and his family are close by.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> CRAIG</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Cradling him) It's about time you lazy people came to help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> STEP OFF, YUGO-BITCH - CRAIG, CAN YOU HEAR ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> HE CAN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE HE IS KNOCKED OUT &mdash; HE NEEDS TO GET TO HOSPITAL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IF YOU GET YOUR FAT CULO OUT OF THE WAY</p>

<div class="stage">Claudia steps in between them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Girls, let's please keep some semblance of calm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> (Holding his children close) Captain Phelps won't wake up but his breathing is steady</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Can you tell me what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> (Wiping away tears) He saved Hannah's life</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> The water was that bad on deck?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> No, they were IN the water</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Hushed) Amazing... they should have drowned in that mess</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> A whole flock of guardian angels must have been looking out for them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Or one in particular</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Nevermind &mdash; we need to get Craig help ASAP &mdash; he's already had his share of nasty head blows</p>

<div class="stage">The crew rushes over and takes Craig away on a stretcher. Ursula and the others follow. Just as Anita starts to leave, her wrist begins to throb. She notices Penelope staring at her from across the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (To a crewman) Why hasn't Miss Renselier been evacuated with the others?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> We were keeping her isolated</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Isolated for what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> Questioning... among other things &mdash; she's the one who found Captain Phelps and the girl</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Wait, I thought they were in the water?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman</span> They were</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Rubbing her head) I'll take care of her &mdash; you get the rest out of here</p>

<div class="stage">With the ship almost deserted now, Anita goes over to a truculent Penelope.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Care to tell me what went down... or up?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Arms folded) Care to tell me why you're leaving me here to die? &mdash; not that I really mind...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Chica, I WAS you ten years ago, now drop the bad-ass teen 'tude and tell me what I need to know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (In Anita's face) I think you already do!</p>

<div class="stage">Penny's eyes start to glow once again as Anita grabs her wrist cast and cries out in pain.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Near the shoreline, a silent Morrigan kneels in the sand and holds up her left hand. Her foot mark glows a bright orange. A baffled Amy watches as the rain pours down.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Can't you tell me what you're doing? &mdash; someone is going to see you and you're going to get caught &mdash; Morrigan... are you listening to me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Chant like) I heard you</p>

<div class="stage">Right on cue, the gleaming orange trident appears from the waves. It drags Darkfin behind in the water and they both wash ashore at Morrigan's feet.</div>
