<div class="stage">Finishing an intense work out at the Le Spa Duchesse gym, Lieutenant Anita Fiore treads into the locker room to change. She
    stops to chat up a few lady friends.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #1</span> (Strutting past) Once again, Fiore, you spun us into the ground during class</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> What can I say, I had a lot of nervous energy that needed to be taken care of</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #2</span> Don't we all</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Loco job duties, crazier family matters - it's enough to make me scream... and that's rare</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #1</span> Heh, yeah</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #2</span> What's the problem, your usual &quot;conduits&quot; not working for you?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Stripping off her clothes) They ALWAYS work for me... just not enough lately</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #1</span> Aww, that's a real shame - so you had to take it out on innocent free weights</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Smirking) Unless you have another suggestion</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #1</span> (Disappearing into the shower) NU-UH, not this time, I've had enough Fiore Frenzy to last me an eternity</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Wrapping herself in a towel) Sorry to hear that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #2</span> She finally grew a conscience</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Heading for the sauna) Good for her... you should try it sometime</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Friend #2</span> (Looking back and winking) Never!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I'll keep that in mind!</p>

<div class="stage">Now inside the steam room, Anita can barley see in front of her. She takes a seat on the wooden bench and feels something
    beneath her.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> GET OFF OF MY HAND, FREAK</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> OH, I'M SO SORRY - I didn't realize... Marcy?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Waving away some of the steam from her face) Anita?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> WELL, Ms. Nolan, imagine running into you... AGAIN</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Hello, Lieutenant</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Are ya following me?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> OF COURSE, that's it, YOU just tried to sit on my fingers without buying me dinner first and I am the one
    that's following you - sure, let's go with that</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v15_steam.jpg" h="532" w="620" b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> You're an actress, you should be able to go with anything</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> That's your rep, isn't it, Fiore?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> No, you see, I stick to one side of the playing field unlike certain others in this room... wait a minute...
    there ARE no others in the room... except you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Let's just say I like to experience the bounty that is life</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Tell me, did you ever experience the bounty that was Jenny?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> You know, your &quot;sister&quot; on the show</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Ah, a conversation about &quot;Life's Little Lessons&quot; - what a surprise</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Singing the theme song)</p>

<div class="stage">
    <blockquote>

        From the bow to the stern
        <br> Every corner, there's a turn
    </blockquote>
</div>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Please don't sing</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Louder)
    <br> Play with fire, you'll get burned
    <br> Finally, one day, you will learn
    <br> Life's - Little - Lessons
</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> And</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> LIFE'SLITTLELESSONS, OY</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Great, did you get that out of your system now?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> You didn't answer my initial question</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Yep, I made my way through all of them, does that satisfy your prurient interests?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Shocked) EVEN RABBI SAUL?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Nope, Rabbi Saul was a eunuch - the result of a very ugly golf cart accident</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> OY</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Stop saying that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Sorry, it's just that I learned everything I know about Judaism from watching Rabbi Saul and the show</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> That's a sad commentary about the education of our American audience but remarkably true - um... you do
    know that he's not a real rabbi, right?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I always wondered</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> He's not even Jewish</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Graham Dobbs, a classically trained English actor</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> NO FREAKING WAY</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> He made us all eat tripe one day as a prank</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Ooh, I don't want to hear anymore</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> So, you don't want to know about Rabbi Saul doing Widow Perkins behind the lighting trucks... before the
    accident that is?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> NOOO - you're shattering my childhood ideal!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Well, I guess you don't want to hear about me doing &quot;Jenny&quot; on location in Japan then?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Come again?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Our first real introduction to sushi</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Seriously?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> We were old enough to share a hotel room - one night in Osaka, her hand went looking for the cookies but
    reached for the wrong jar</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Doing a little dance) I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Don't soil yourself, Lieutenant, EVERYONE knew it just by watching us - the producers knew it, the network
    suits knew it, even Snappy the one-eyed turtle knew it</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Aww, I loved Snappy!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Total prop</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> AAAARRGH</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> On some sick level of total denial, our parents knew it as well - but no one was willing to admit it -
    the money was too good</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Legalized kiddie porn?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Maybe just a shade above it but I sure felt like I was being pimped</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Who knew that a sitcom about a rabbi taking care of five orphaned siblings in 1920's Toronto would be such
    a big hit?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Or a musical - don't forget that wonderful aspect!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm amazed it lasted for ten years</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Nine years too many for me - my entire puberty was caught on film and I can relive the wonders of it in
    just about any country that has cable</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> That's kinda scary</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> YEAH, IT IS</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Back to &quot;Jenny?&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Right, back to SARA... her real name</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I know</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Just a reminder, we do have real names</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I'll make a note of it</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> The on-screen chemistry I had with Sara was even more intense off-screen - being the same age, we literally
    grew up together - two kids from opposite ends of the country enjoying fame and fortune and rampaging hormones...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I thought you had this big romance going with that Olympic skier guy?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Bobby, yep, that was arranged by the producers - they also set up Sara with the mayor's son... she's married
    to him now with four kids</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Wow - so I guess it worked out?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> I guess you could say that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Sorry</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Nah, it was mostly a teenage crush thing coupled with the fact that she was the only person in the whole
    world who knew exactly what I was going through - &quot;Jackie&quot; and &quot;Julie&quot; were too young and &quot;Johnny&quot;
    was too busy porking Widow Perkins when other crew members weren't</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> WIDOW PERKINS WAS A SLUT</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Slight laugh) Tell me about it!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> You... um didn't, I mean...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> ARE YOU KIDDING? - I have some standards</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Sighing) Good</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Playfully) Not for you, it isn't</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Hey</p>

<div class="stage">The two chuckle and shift positions.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> So, are you going to do the reunion movie?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Not in this lifetime or the next</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> C'MON, YOU HAVE TO</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> No, I do not - I am done with the character of &quot;Jamie&quot; - I owe her nothing and I owe the audience
    nothing - in fact, they are the ones who owe me</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> You're being a total diva!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Nope, it's called self-respect... what little of it I still managed to hang on to in this business</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Gimme a break, lady, your career revolves around &quot;B&quot; films and playing a freaking space frog
    - I highly doubt going back to the role that lined your pockets and made you famous is going to typecast someone who
    is on the other side of 25</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> You'll never understand</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Do a better job of convincing me</p>

<div class="stage">One of the spa attendants pokes her head in the door.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Attendant</span> Jamie... I'm so sorry, I meant Ms. Nolan, it's time for your milk bath and mud mask</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Getting up and glaring at Anita) Thanks</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Attendant</span> It's just that I think of you as Jamie</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> I understand</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Attendant</span> Maybe I could get an autograph from you after the bath... it's for my little sister of course</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Walking out the door) Of course</p>

<div class="stage">Now relaxing in a private room, submerged in a milk bath with a mud mask covering her face and cucumber slices over her eyes,
    Marcy takes in the soothing scents of aromatherapy while listening to smooth jazz over the sound system.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v15_marcy_bath.jpg" h="466" w="520" b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (In a robe and closing the door behind her) I can't believe you listen to this crap</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Not moving) I like this crap - why are you in here, Lieutenant, this is a private room?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Taking a seat next to the tub) I came in here to apologize - I guess I can see how being Jamie has a few
    drawbacks</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Mmm - apology accepted</p>

<div class="stage">Anita lingers and says nothing.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Is that it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Getting up to leave) Enjoy the rest of your rest</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Taking the slices off of her eyes) Anita, wait...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> What?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> I... I like talking with you - stay... if you'd like</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Returning to the side of the tub) Alright</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Tell me about yourself - your job, family</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Actually, I came here today to forget about my job and family - I hope you don't mind</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> I understand - so, what should we talk about?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Raising an eyebrow) Do we have to talk?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Heh, yes, for now we do</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> OK</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> We can switch back to talking about me - actors are incredibly self-involved, we have to be</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I think I've met my match!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> We'll see about that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I have a question for you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Go ahead</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Folding her arms) Why Ned?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Why not Ned?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Is he what you want in bed</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Some of the time</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Flake</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Flake, coward, whore... I've heard it all before - but it doesn't change the fact that I like doing it
    with guys - I just happen to like doing it with girls as well</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Why can't you decide?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Why should I have to? - have you ever been with a man?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Adamant) Never</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Ever have the urge to?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (More adamant) Never</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> See, you're a lesbian and I respect that - I wish you could show me the same respect</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I respect those who know who they are</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> I know exactly who I am - I am a bisexual and that's a huge difference, I value the person, not the body
    part</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Standing up) Oh yeah? - I can guess which part on Ned you value the most</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> It's more than that - I might give off a strong masculine vibe, but I really do like pink roses and lace
    curtains... along with the hockey and the sports cars - I just find a man who likes to cook and do the laundry, it's
    a nice yin yang balance</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> And the part of you staring inside my robe opening, what part of the equation does that balance out to?
</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> It's called enjoying the view</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Do you love him?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> I do</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> Then why am I wasting my time here?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Do you consider it a waste?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> I like friendly chatter as much as the next person but when I'm right next to a beautiful woman in a milk
    bath and nothing is going to come of it besides more talking, yeah, I do consider it a waste of my time</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Who is to say nothing will come of it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> You just said earlier that...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Not here - you think I would be stupid enough to risk doing it in a public place? - I may be playing a
    space frog to you but I happen to love my job</p>

<div class="stage">Growing frustrated, Anita stomps about the room.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Show some patience, Fiore... and some brains</p>

<div class="stage">Marcy slowly gets out of the tub with Anita watching appreciatively.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> Don't just stand there like a moron, gimme your robe!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Anita</span> There's another one hanging on the door, get it yourself</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Untying Anita's belt) I want yours</p>

<div class="stage">Lieutenant Fiore finally complies. Now standing there naked, she helps a grinning Ms. Nolan into the robe and then quickly
    heads out for the showers. Anita spends about fifteen minutes under the streams of cold water, trying to process the
    discussion, when a fully-dressed Marcy pokes her head in past the thin plastic curtain.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Marcy</span> (Taking a long look and then in a low voice) Next Tuesday night at the Quartz Lake Inn... if you think
