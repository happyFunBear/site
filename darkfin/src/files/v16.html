<div class="stage">Sitting around a small table inside the SCU Biology &amp; Aquatics department staff room, Dr. Javier Sanchez and Dr. Shelby Willis go over semester grades and other business.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking at his watch) Well, the meeting was called for 3:00 - it's now 3:20</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Timothy should be here soon, he was finishing up a lab tutorial</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Maybe when Hajanian and Erika finally become parents, they'll learn how to be more prompt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Raising an eyebrow) You were late three times last week</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Yes, but I had my reasons... my children</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> You mean the actual offspring you had with your wife or the cluster of freshmen hanging around your office door?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Jealous, Shel? - the student reports on you are solid - they give you high marks on conveying your knowledge in a helpful and informative way but they classify your manner as &quot;brusque&quot; - try lightening up a little and you could very well have your own pack of freshmen hanging on your door next semester!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Folding her arms) NO THANK YOU - I already have one son hanging on to my leg, that's more than enough for now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Sipping his coffee) Try having an adult male grab a hold of your legs and throw them over his shoulders, you'll have more fun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Smacking him on the arm with a file) I do believe you just violated SCU Code of Conduct rule 42 subsection C - sexual harassment!</p>

<img  src="assets/images/v16_shelby-sandy.jpg" h="445" w="620"  b="0">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Is it HARassment or harASSment?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Do I look like an English major?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> No, but you sure sound like one - by the way, the damn Lit. Department has twice as many awards and grants this year</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Sighing) Yes, I am painfully aware of that - that's why I'm going to have to sue you for your prior comment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You are more than welcome to do so - I can give you the second mortgage on my house, a car that needs a new transmission, my $5000.00 in credit card debt and my wife's alarm clock that plays the soundtrack to &quot;Grease&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Nevermind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Tapping his pen) The smart thing to do would be to sue Erika for wasting our time here - the von Meers could easily part with a moneybag or two</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Turning serious) I am growing concerned about her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You're concerned about everyone, Shelby, that's why you get the best birthday presents from the office secretaries</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I am not joshing around, Sandy, there is something going on with her - she hasn't been right for awhile now - everyone keeps asking me what &quot;big project&quot; has Erika so busy all the time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Eyes lighting up) Project?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> There IS no project... at least that I am aware of - she has the same work load as I do and her research is far from earth-shattering</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Who asked you about her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Her brother, for one - and Griffin... oh, and another man on the phone who wouldn't leave his name - it was quite odd</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Slamming his hand on his notepad) DAMMIT - I knew it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> She has a secret project - probably some tip off from her father's company - she's going to do it all herself and get all the glory, leaving us in the lurch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Oh, I don't know about that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You know how these rich white people are, they stick together, keeping everything in the inner circle... keeping us out!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Come now, this has nothing to do with race</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> It ALWAYS has something to do with race</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Sorry, I just don't believe that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> That's right, you're off playing polo with them all the time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I happen to like polo</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You happen to like Captain Crunch - am I right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Looking away) You are a madman, I have no clue as to what you are thinking in that nasty little head of yours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You have it so bad for Craig, whenever the Coast Guard calls for info, you gallop to the phone!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I do not gallop</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> You do too, I saw it with my own eyes... twice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Well... even if I did, he certainly wouldn't be interested in me - I have a young child</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> So? - doesn't he have a daughter?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> It's just different for men, besides she lives with the ex-wife</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Eh, I wouldn't waste your time with him, he seems like a stuffed shirt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Impish grin) His pants are stuffed with vigor and that's what counts</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> It's my turn to sue for sexual harassment now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Unfortunately, a rather large negative against the fine Phelps is his current involvement with one Ursula Martel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Gasping) NOT R'XAL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> A &quot;rumor&quot; of course - I can't believe you watch that silly space show!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Clearing his throat) My sons do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Checking over some notes) Mm-hmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> That's funny, Oni tells me my sister-in-law has Ursula's co-star set in her sights</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Wide-eyed) NOT JAMIE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> HA - I can't believe you watch that stupid old sitcom!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Calvin does - it's on the Rerun Network every night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Winking) Yeahuh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Tell me, has Anita talked to you at all about what she's doing with Craig?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> What is she doing with Craig?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Obviously not, then</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Is it Coast Guard related?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I am not certain - some of the questions that he has been asking me lately are not typical</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Can you cite an example?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> &quot;Have there been any recent sea mammal anomalies discovered in the area?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Scratching his beard) That is bizarre - someone obviously knows something here and we're being kept out of the loop - you keep working on Craig and I'll grill Anita - this school NEEDS a big discovery to put us on the academic map, we've been riding on past glories for far too long</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Our Santa Conchita River spill studies were in two scientific journals?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> That's not enough, we need something more... soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Glancing at the wall clock) Be sure to bring it up at our next meeting, I need to get going - I have to pick up Calvin and then get ready for my date tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Oooh, a date?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Don't sound so surprised</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Do I know the man, is he as handsome as I am?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Jason Clark and if he looked remotely like you, I would not be going out on a date with him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> OUCH - he's kind of young for you, isn't he?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Not as young as yours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Waving a white paper napkin) I surrender</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> He seems like a gentleman yet there is also an unnerving aura about him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Tell him to switch deodorants</p>

<div class="stage">Striding into the room, a disheveled Dr. Erika von Meer approaches the table and drops a stack of files on the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> This is my course curriculum for next semester</p>

<div class="stage">She drops another stack of files on the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> These are my students' grades and papers for last semester</p>

<div class="stage">She drops a spreadsheet on the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> These are the current expenditures for my lab experiments and what I'd like to see added in the new budget - it's all very straightforward, I've highlighted areas that might be brought into question - if you need to go over it in detail with me, let me know and we'll set up a time</p>

<div class="stage">Erika forces a smile and turns to leave.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Gruff) Dr. von Meer, SIT DOWN</p>

<div class="stage">Erika scowls at him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Softening) Erika... please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Doing so) What's the problem, Sandy?</p>

<div class="stage">Before he can respond, Tim Hajanian enters the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Catching his breath) Thank you all for starting the meeting without me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I just got here myself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Sneering at Erika) Surprise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> You both are over a half hour late - Sandy and I have family plans to work around</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> You know what, I am really sorry about that - I'm happy you both decided to have children but that decision should not affect me - it's not fair - just because I am a single man does not mean that I DON'T have a life!</p>

<div class="stage">Erika sits back as Sandy and Shelby exchange looks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I was late because I was busy taking care of a tutorial that one of YOU was supposed to help me with</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> We knew you could handle it yourself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Man, that is a tired excuse, try to think of something original for once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Timothy, you would be wise to watch what you say</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Shrugging) What? - are you going to toss a bunch of coconuts into the ocean if I dis you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Standing up) Are you making fun of my religion, you deviant piss?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Will everyone please calm it down?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Look, I have an art exhibit this weekend to prepare for - have any of you seen my sculptures? - do any of you even ASK about my art? - NO - but I'm supposed to give a crap about your kids and come to the rescue every time there's a bruised knee</p>

<img  src="assets/images/v16_erika-tim.jpg" h="529" w="570"  b="0">

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> We're sorry that you feel that way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> You all seem to assume that I can be counted on to take the shit jobs while you and the kiddies go picnic in a park - well, I'm done with the burden of your spawning</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> His point is crude but correct</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> You don't have to fight my battles, Erika, I am sick and tired of you disappearing all the time - where in the hell do you go? - have you become a junkie because you look like death warmed over</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Losing his temper) MISTER Hajanian, you seem to be forgetting that DR. Willis, DR. von Meer, and myself rank above you in this department and you will do what is asked of you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Throwing his files on the table) Not if I'm not around to do it - good fucking luck trying to find another flunky that's as efficient as I am - when you're ready to discuss my part in this little powwow, be sure to let me know</p>

<div class="stage">The room is silent as Hajanian storms out the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Casually) George took Lydia and Penny with him to DC this week</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Ah, OK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Standing) I need to get going, we'll discuss all of this tomorrow... and let us make it a point to go see Timothy's sculptures</p>

<div class="stage">Erika and Sandy watch her leave. Before the blonde woman can say or do anything, she feels the sweaty hand of the man across from her take her fingers into his.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Rica... I need you to be honest with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking into his eyes) About what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Everything</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Snapping her hand away and leaving) Not today</p>
