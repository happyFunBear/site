<div class="stage">Creeping along the Santa Conchita riverbank in Tim's
 Jeep, Erika returns to the mountains.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Pulling over and jumping out) I believe it was around
 here somewhere...</p>

<div class="stage">She searches Tim's black bag and grabs a hold of something
 in the palm of her hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Holding her clenched fist in the air) This should help</p>

<div class="stage">Like a shot, Erika now hurries off into the forest.
 Moments later, she comes to the rock with the trident.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> A-ha, there you are!</p>

<div class="stage">Underneath the bloody prongs is a lifeless brown hood.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (To the trident) Good job</p>

<div class="stage">She scans across the river to the Don Alessandro foothills.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Great aim, Morrigan</p>

<div class="stage">Erika uses her foot to hold down the body and yanks
 the trident out of the flesh and rock. The hood suddenly comes to life
 and grabs her ankle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't think so...</p>

<div class="stage">She swings the trident around and jabs the heavy balled
 end. The hood's skull is crushed against the rock. Blood and brain
 ooze all over her feet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Messy, messy</p>
<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c15_erika_hilltop.jpg" alt="" h="492" w="605"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">A loud explosion echoes down the canyon.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking in the distance) Now what?</p>

<div class="stage">A few miles away, the KCON newsvan is in cinders. Joenne
 has tackled the agent with the launcher too late.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> JUSTINE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Agent</span> I... didn't have time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Running towards the van) NO, OH NOOO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Agent</span> We didn't know...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> WHY?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Agent</span> You told me to fire...</p>

<div class="stage">Ignoring the agent, Joenne is now at the smoldering
 vehicle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (In tears) Why was she here?</p>

<div class="stage">There is a rustle in the shrubs. Both Joenne and the
 agent aim their weapons. Justine, all singed and shaken, throws up
 her hands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU, JOEY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> JUSTI</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne runs over to her as Justine attempts to get up
 but stumbles backwards and falls on her rear.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Ow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Thank God you got out in time!</p>

<div class="stage">The two embrace. Justine then punches Joenne hard on
 the arm.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE YOU DOING? - WHY DID YOU FIRE
 A MISSILE AT ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I WASN'T THE ONE WHO FIRED IT AND IF I DID, IT WOULDN'T
 HAVE BEEN ON PURPOSE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> OH, THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> WHY DID YOU FOLLOW ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> WHY CAN'T YOU STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> YOU ARE MY FAMILY ERGO MY BUSINESS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> ERGO?</p>

<div class="stage">The agent with the launcher clears his throat and looks
 away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I'm sorry... we couldn't allow anyone past a certain
 point - especially the media</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> We? - care to explain who WE is, Joey?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> C'mon, we gotta move</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Getting up slowly) I liked you better when you were
 a promiscuous street junkie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Helping her) Yeah, so did I</p>

<div class="stage">Sparks pop out of the newsvan remnants as they pass
 by.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> So much for Gracie's &quot;rolling turd&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> SHE WASN'T INSIDE, WAS SHE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> No, just me - I borrowed it to come look for you</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne smiles at her sister. Justine suddenly pinches
 Joenne hard on the arm.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Hey!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> And THAT was for knocking me out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I can't believe my sister boosted a newsvan</p>

<div class="stage">The two chuckle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Agent</span> What's the plan now, Mirabello?</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne freezes in her tracks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Aw shit, I almost forgot about it</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne takes off running with the agent following and
 Justine lagging behind. They all arrive at the rock with the bloody
 brown hood.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> IT'S GONE, DAMMIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Agent</span> What's gone?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> It must be in the area - ALL UNITS, SEARCH THESE COORIDINATES
 IMMEDIATELY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Agent</span> WHAT ARE WE SEARCHING FOR?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> You'll know it when you see it</p>

<div class="stage">An out-of-breath Justine is busy checking out the hood
 body.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> And I though I've seen it all - wait a sec... a three-pronged
 entry wound</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Agent</span> (To Joenne) She shouldn't be here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I'll take full responsibility</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> And this guy's innards match Father Greg's - Joey,
 you need to explain all this to me, right now... and then I'll tell
 you what I know</p>

<div class="stage">A support helicopter swoops down overhead.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (To Joenne) Later, we need to move...</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside the tunnel, Griffin steps out of the limo as
 a wide-eyed KJ stares at the crew of hoods before them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (To KJ) Quickly, let's go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Their eyes...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> It's the lighting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Um... if you say so</p>

<div class="stage">A blue hood beckons to Griffin. They follow it deeper
 into the tunnel.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> We need to meet with Father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Doug? - what is he doing here?</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin gives KJ a look but does not answer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Nervous) Grif, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me
 what the deal is with this frat hazing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You're already an exclusive member, Kage</p>

<div class="stage">KJ reluctantly trails Griffin and the blue hood into
 a dimly-lit chamber. Other Clergy members stand and wait at an empty
 hall.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c15_hood_cave.jpg" alt="" h="564" w="703"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Whispering to Griffin) Can you at least tell me why everyone
 is dressed like an overgrown Jawa?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Show some respect...</p>

<div class="stage">The White Robed Leader floats down the hall and settles
 before them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Bowing) These are our ultimate business partners</p>

<div class="stage">KJ is speechless for a moment but chooses not to believe
 what is before his eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Killer wire trick but what does this have to do with shipping?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (To the White Hood) Greetings, Father - you summoned
 us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Hood</span> Drilling will commence in a matter of days - you
 need to be ready on your part</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Trying not to show panic) DAYS? - forgive me, but
 I was under the impression that we had weeks, even months?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Hood</span> The timetable has been moved up</p>

<div class="stage">The leader glides right by Griffin and goes before KJ.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Hood</span> Is he worthy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Angered) Worthy of what? - your stupid little costume
 party?</p>

<div class="stage">The von Meer son turns his back and starts to walk away.
 The leader snaps a finger, causing KJ to flip over several times. He
 lands hard on his side as the hoods snicker.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> MOTHER FUC...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (To KJ) Stay down, shut it, and let me talk!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Hood</span> You need to keep him under control, Martel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes, Father</p>

<div class="stage">A blue hood hands Griffin a laptop computer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Hood</span> Study the plans - both of you will be needed for
 service very soon</p>

<div class="stage">The White Hood begins to float away. KJ scrambles to
 his feet and runs after it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I don't do business with someone who's afraid to show me
 their face!</p>

<div class="stage">The leader allows the KJ to pull back the white hood
 from its face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> YOU</p>

<div class="stage">It smiles and then delivers a sharp blow to KJ's jaw.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Back at her house, Morrigan slowly steps away from Tallulah's
 terrarium, her eyes trained on Amy the entire time. Amy smiles softly
 as her eyes glow and all the candles in the room ignite at the wave
 of her hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I would never let any harm come to your pet, you
 know that</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan's eyes now match Amy's in color and intensity.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> But sacrificing me or Zach is not a problem?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Serious) Zachary is safe... and so are you, Marked
 One</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No thanks to you and your creepy clan - and the name
 is Morrigan!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I never had a say in whether you lived...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Or died...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> It's beyond that now - you know this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Tell me to my face - are you going to kill me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I would never do that, I could never do that</p>

<div class="stage">The two slowly circle each other around the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Peering out the window) Are you going to betray
 me to the hoods again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Unfortunately, everything is already set in motion
 - they no longer have a need for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Right now</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan suddenly feels lightheaded and takes a seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You have been through a lot, you should get some
 rest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not until you tell me more about The Clergy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I'll get us something to eat, first</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan thinks for a second. Her hunger overrules her
 curiosity.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Fine</p>

<div class="stage">As Amy leaves, Morrigan goes to take Tallulah out of
 her terrarium. At first, the tarantula cowers away but then quickly
 warms to her touch. Morrigan catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Wincing at the image) And people think spiders are
 scary</p>

<div class="stage">Amy now returns with some bread, cheese, fruit, and
 tea.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You never had a problem with nature...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Throughout your life - animals, plants, people -
 they're all drawn to you...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My stepmom would disagree with that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Heh, even the most bizarre creatures find you attractive</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan ponders quietly as she nibbles a slice of cheese.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Consider it a blessing for you get your strength
 from them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Then why do I feel so damn weak right now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> The fact that you even survived last night is a marvel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Have I earned a colorful cape?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You might want to save that for your friend</p>

<div class="stage">An alarmed Morrigan realizes that Amy knows about Darkfin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Enough with delay tactics, tell me about The Clergy
 - now!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Remember the legend KJ told you about Duquesa Bay?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Vaguely - some royal chick cheated on her dickwad
 husband with a monk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> The duchess Leticia, her husband the admiral, and
 Padre Ernesto - the Spanish sought precious metals here long before
 California's Gold Rush days - but they discovered something else...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nereidium</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Yes, however, the missionaries and the Chumash natives
 were infiltrated by The Clergy... Padre Ernesto was one of them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sipping her tea) Go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Ernesto was sadistically beheaded by Bernardo Martinez
 for having an affair with his wife - this infuriated The Clergy and
 they hunted the admiral down and eviscerated him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Chomping on an apple) Lovely</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> But not before the admiral had alerted Madrid about
 the presence of Metal del Demonio and El Clero - they were now exposed
 beyond fable and folklore - it's been an underground battle ever since</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And where do I come into this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You were born into this - as was I</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Mocking) Yay for us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> As you grew up, you saw how the mark on your foot
 changed with age but you never questioned it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Whenever I did, I was instantly hushed up - after
 my mother and brother died... I had other things on my mind</p>

<div class="stage">Amethyst places a comforting hand on Morrigan's back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You have been watched since birth... before birth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Joe Tiszo, your family... and my Father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you going to tell me about him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> When you tell me about Aleta Oscura</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Erika pulls the Jeep into a far back lot on the SCU
 campus. Making sure nobody is around, she climbs out with the trident
 and Tim's black bag in hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Leaving the keys under the seat) Thanks for the lift,
 Timmy</p>

<div class="stage">She stealthily moves across campus until she reaches
 an unavoidable security kiosk. A plump, middle-aged guard is slurping
 coffee.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Guard</span> (Wiping his mouth) How ya doin' tonight, Dr. von Meer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Sorry, forgot my badge again</p>

<div class="stage">He notices the trident and gives her a quizzical look.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Drama department property</p>

<div class="stage">He winks and nods for her to go through.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Guard</span> Hey</p>

<div class="stage">She freezes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Guard</span> Real sorry about your dad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Erika now heads down a hall, up a flight of stairs,
 and into the lab. She hides the bag and trident in a cabinet, then
 checks on some beakers and sample dishes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You better hope this antidote is working on my father,
 Rif</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly feeling faint, she staggers over to a chair
 and collects herself. After a few deep breaths, she checks her pulse.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> My levels are undoubtedly off</p>

<div class="stage">After a minute of rest, Erika scribbles some notes in
 a book and checks her computer. Footsteps down the hall cause her to
 stiffen. They approach but never come inside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Exhaling) I can't do this here</p>

<div class="stage">She stashes some supplies in her pockets. Then she snatches
 Tim's black bag, grabs the trident and takes off. Erika makes her way
 to the beach from the campus.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Scanning around) At least Mt. Wiggins is keeping everyone
 preoccupied</p>

<div class="stage">Erika now reaches the marina and her boat. Once inside,
 she downs a bottle of Gatorade and tosses the trident and black bag
 on the bed.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Why does this have to be so hard, Sam?</p>

<div class="stage">Completely exhausted, she falls on her bed and sobs
 uncontrollably. Her foot accidentally knocks the black bag on the floor.
 The contents spill everywhere.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Staring down at the floor) What are you looking at?</p>

<div class="stage">Staring back is a human skull, dozens of Nereidium coins,
 and three sticks of dynamite.</div>
