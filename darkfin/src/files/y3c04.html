<div class="stage">Inside a small cavern deep beneath the Kiyomis, Amethyst Hill lies curled up on the ground, shivering. Still without clothes, she rocks back and forth, trying to meditate as a folded, blue-colored robe is placed next to her. The Leader of the Clergy enters the chamber and now stands before the prisoner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Picking up the blue robe and trying to cover her with it) Stubborn child, why must you always defy me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Pushing the garment away) I'D RATHER DIE THAN WEAR THAT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Considering the temperature will drop to the low 30's in here, you just might</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Don't worry, I won't be here that much longer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Reclining against a rock) Oh really?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Struggling to sit up) You have either two choices - kill me or let me go - and since I'm still breathing, the first option seems a little weak</p>

<div class="stage">Gasping for breath, she is suddenly raised to her feet without a hand touching her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Did I not teach you about overconfidence?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Narrowing her eyes) Yes... YOU DID</p>

<div class="stage">The Leader momentarily loses power and snaps backward as Amy gains control over herself.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Now clapping) Brava, your mother would be so proud</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Turning away from the figure) I will NOT let you get to my soul!</p>

<div class="stage">The leader silently summons two subordinates in brown robes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Watching) You can force whatever you want on me, physically, but I will never comply</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> We shall see</p>

<div class="stage">With a simple gesture, the leader directs the other two to keep the squirming woman in place as the blue robe is quickly wrapped around her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Gently pulling the hood around her face) Why must you struggle against your destiny, why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> It is no longer a destiny I choose to follow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> HA, as if you had a choice in the matter!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> There is always a choice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Come, come - I raised you better than that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> YOU DIDN'T RAISE ME AT ALL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Now pacing) Not so long ago, you were a very willing participant in this - why do you think the Marked One ended up living under your roof?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I will admit to being led astray by your prophecies - NO LONGER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Fight me all you want but you cannot fight what will be - you are aware of the time - you watch the constellations at night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I am also aware that plans do not always go accordingly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> How very true - follow me!</p>

<div class="stage">With the brown figures on either side, Amy reluctantly follows the leader through the cavern into an open chamber. They are looking down from the craggy rock cliff.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> You are indeed right for I cannot kill my own flesh - but before I return you to your pretty kitties and precious vegetable garden, you might want to consider this...</p>

<div class="stage">The leader snaps his fingers and four blue robes appear at the bottom of the chamber. They are carrying in a limp, badly battered man with his eyes blindfolded. Amy angles for a closer look.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> No, no... not him - PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> We found your friend wandering, looking for something... or someone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> ZAAACH</p>

<div class="stage">He does not respond.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Now that you are aware of the price, be sure to bring us Morrigan by tomorrow eve</p> 

<hr>

<div class="stage">Outside the von Meer estate, an enraged Erika has Stephanie pushed up against the sidewall of the garage.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> MY FATHER DID NOT DIE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Struggling) ERIKA, STOP THIS AT ONCE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> NOT UNTIL YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH</p>

<div class="stage">A florist van pulls up into the driveway, causing both women to step back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I know you're upset, honey, but this is not going to help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> And I know you're lying to me, Stephanie, you have the same guilty eye twitch as your son</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> What did Griffin say to you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Griffin has nothing to do with this... but I know you do - you know I can do just about anything in this town with my family's name and money and if that means buying every single coroner from here to San Diego to tell me the truth about what really happened, I will!</p>

<div class="stage">Stephanie rubs her face and stands in silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> KJ and my mother might be too grief-stricken to question the &quot;foul-up&quot; with his body but I don't believe it, not for a second - and since you were the last attending physician to see him... DO YOU NEED ME TO KEEP SPELLING IT OUT FOR YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Erika, PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Or maybe we'll bring Kylee Shepperton over here and let the KCON viewers decide!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> ENOUGH - get into my car!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> This better not be a diversionary trip</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> You'll see</p>

<div class="stage">The two hop into a tan SUV and take off.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">At the abandoned field house on the edge of Fiore Farms, Hector Tapia paces beside the bed of an unconscious Karl Senior.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm going to have a hell of a time getting you into the car by myself</p>

<div class="stage">He starts to pack some medical equipment in a bag.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Stephi is going to kill me, especially if you drop dead... but my family suspects something is going on down here - Francis is already knee-deep in his own shit with the shooting, I'm not about to involve the others</p>

<div class="stage">Riding down a dirt path on her motorcycle, Anita comes up on the house and searches for her uncle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> TIO - HEY, HECTOR, DONDE ESTAS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Dropping the bags) Shit!</p>

<div class="stage">He rushes out the door before she can come inside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> 'Nita - I thought you had a Coast Guard meeting to get to?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Trying to peer inside) I do but I wanted to make sure everything was cool down here... is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> It's fine, perfecto!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Es verdad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Really - just a few vagrants looking for some shelter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> This is not the Hotel Fiore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Where is your compassion, chica?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm pretty much out of it these days - especially with all of the weird crap that's been happening</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Still blocking the door) They are just harmless vagrants</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Good, they can go be harmless under the pier with all of the others</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I cannot believe I am hearing these words out of your mouth - forget compassion, where is your tolerance?</p>

<div class="stage">These words freeze Anita momentarily.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I will not tolerate my family in danger</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Like I said, they are harmless - in need of a roof and a good meal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Then take them to the mission, let JC come up with the loaves and fishes to feed them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> They pose no threat to Frank and Carmen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> How can you be so sure?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I've seen enough in prison to know whom I can trust</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You always have to throw that out there, don't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> My instincts are reliable</p>

<div class="stage">He looks down at her wrist in a brace.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Can you say the same about yours?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> That's a low blow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> You never did say what really happened to you and Craig in the copter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Quit trying to change the subject</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'd like to know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> That makes two of us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> You know, you can tell me anything - you always have</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I know that and I would if I could - para seguro!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> You've also been tight-lipped about this Marcy woman</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Sighing) Literally</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Is she just another one of many or is she special to you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Look, Hector, another time - what I really need to know is if you know anything about my bracelet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> You mean abuelita's?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Whatever</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Not much, that's your mother's legacy - it was passed down to her - why are you curious?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I need to find out more about it... there's something about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I could ask your mother for you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Glancing at her watch) No, that's OK - I need to take off for my meeting - wish me luck... and I want these bums off of the property, pronto!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Do you honestly think I would put my own sister in danger?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Not intentionally - now go ask Oni about one of her charities and get them another place to stay - hell, here's twenty bucks, take them for some tacos when you leave</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> They'll be gone before you get back, I promise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Walking back to her bike and waving her hand) Gracias!</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">On the way to the Fiore property, Stephanie explains what she knows about Karl's poisoning to Erika.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Softly) Thank you for taking care of him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Always</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Have you isolated the toxin yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Not entirely, there is still a very strong chance he could die</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Eyes filled with tears) I'll figure it out in the lab but first I must see him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> We're almost there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm sorry for the way I treated you earlier - I was upset</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> You still are... and have every right to be</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> How come you trusted me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I've known you since before you were born, Erika - there's no way you could have done this to your father - and you were well on your way to figuring the situation on your own</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> But you still suspect my mother or KJ?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> No, but I don't know who they are in contact with - I just can't take the chance of more people knowing - having you know is enough of a risk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Can we trust Hector?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> It was a spur-of-the-moment decision but I believe it was the right one - no matter what has happened between us, we share a unique bond</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> She has your eyes, you know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Please, not now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Forgive me</p>

<div class="stage">A radio news update blares the latest headlines, focusing on the supposed death of Karl. Stephanie goes to turn it off but Erika stops her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Wait!</p>

<div class="stage">They now mention the on-going manhunt for the still missing Morrigan McBride.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rubbing her hands) I need to find her before they do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Nothing, nevermind</p>

<div class="stage">Before Dr. Gates can question the von Meer daughter any further, Anita Fiore comes zooming down the road towards them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Dammit, we don't need to deal with her right now!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Keep calm and let me handle this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Gladly</p>

<div class="stage">Stunned by the sight of Stephanie's SUV headed down the back road to her property. Anita slows down and pulls up alongside the window.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Taking off her helmet) Dr. Gates?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Hello, Anita, how are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> What are you doing here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I have some business with your Uncle Hector</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Spying Erika in the car) Really? - huh, I must say that I'm kinda surprised to see you here, Dr. von Meer... sorry about your dad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Gritting her teeth) Thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I was just taking her on a ride to clear her head - we need to speak with Hector for a moment and then we'll be on our way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> He's probably still at the field house taking care of some bums</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span>(Nearly choking on her breath) Bums?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah - I should be helping out but I need to report to HQ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Scowling) Don't let us keep you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Actually... I still have a few moments - maybe I'll follow you two back in case you need an extra hand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Peering at the wrist brace) How IS your hand, Anita? - are you sure you can handle a motorcycle with your injury?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I can handle it fine... thank you for your concern</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> How exactly again did you hurt it?</p>

<div class="stage">There is a long, silent pause.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You know what? - I actually do need to get going - please give your family my condolences, Rikka... my sister should be over there with a casserole soon - if there's anything else we can do, be sure to give us a call!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Monotone) Thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Bye, Anita!</p>

<div class="stage">And with that, the two vehicles drive off in opposite directions. Stephanie and Erika reach the field house just as Hector is loading some equipment into his car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Hey, Hector - what are you doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm getting him out of here - Anita almost found out and it's only a matter of time before Carmen and Frank start stumbling around - WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?</p>

<div class="stage">Without saying a word, Erika rushes inside to see her father.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> It's okay, she's safe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Are you sure about that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I'm not sure about anything anymore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> We still need to get him out of here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Where are you taking him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I have some friends up north that owe me a favor - they have a cabin about two hours from here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> NO - he'll never survive the trip!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm running out of options, Stephi!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> We'll take him to the Quartz Lake Inn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Oh right - we'll just check him in with the baggage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Big Joe will take care of us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> You're bringing in another outsider? - this whole town will know about Karl by nightfall</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Joe is a former priest, he can be trusted</p>

<div class="stage">Hector laughs and shakes his head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Let's move</p>

<div class="stage">They hurry inside to find Erika silently grasping her father's hand and holding back the tears.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Barely above a whisper) His vitals are very weak</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Coming over and checking Karl) I know, sweetie, but we have no choice - help me with his transfer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Where are we going?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Packing up more gear) To the Quartz Lake Inn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Of course - Joe is back at the house but I know how to get in through the wine cellar</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Unhooking an IV bag) Let's make it quick but careful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking up) Mr. Tapia</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Hector, por favor!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Hector... thank you for everything</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> No problem - it has actually given me some wonderful source material for my current literary project</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Exasperated) Still dreaming about the great unwritten novel, Hec?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> It's almost done, it really is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Double checking everything) I think we're all set</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Putting a hand on the senior von Meer's leg) Hang on, Karl, time for another ride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Let's go! </p>

<hr>
<div class="stage">Now dressed in a velour jog suit borrowed from the Quartz Lake gym, a fully cognizant Morrigan anxiously awaits Joe Tiszo's return.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still limping with her bandaged foot) This is crazy, I need to do something - I can't just stay here!</p>

<div class="stage">She pulls the hood of the jacket over her head and packs a few bottles of water in a sack.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have to get to Concha Dos... I have to get to her</p>

<div class="stage">Before Morrigan can climb the stairs leading out of the cellar, a service elevator suddenly opens on the opposite side.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Under her breath) Shit!</p>

<div class="stage">She hobbles quickly in back of some wine racks and observes the scene before her. Hector, Stephanie and Erika wheel in Karl senior. Morrigan gasps in astonishment causing Erika to look in her direction.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c04_morri_cellar.jpg" h="411" w="460"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Did you hear something?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Turning away) No, keep him steady - his blood pressure is fluctuating</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> It was probably just a rat - let's hope Joe gets back soon so we can get Karl into a proper room</p>

<div class="stage">The three continue to set up Karl in the cellar as Morrigan is frozen silent.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm going back upstairs to keep an eye out - do you need anything?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> As tempting as Joe's chardonnay is, I think we'd be better off with some water</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Actually, Steph, would you mind getting it? - I'd like to spend some time with my father alone</p>

<div class="stage">Stephanie just stares at Erika for a minute.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Don't worry, I'm not going to kill him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Guilty expression) I was not thinking that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking her hand and squeezing it) Yes, you were thinking that... thank you for being so protective of him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I'll be back in a few minutes - come on, Hector</p>

<div class="stage">After the two leave, Erika places a soft kiss on her father's forehead and casually makes her way towards the wine racks. Morrigan holds her breath and slowly creeps behind another rack. The two play a short game of maze chase until Morrigan ends up backing into Erika.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh... hi - your father's okay - are you okay?</p>

<div class="stage">Unable to find the right words to respond with, Erika reaches out and pulls Morrigan into a hug.</div>
