<div class="stage">Across the street from the Quartz County Morgue, Fingers and Eyes recline in Zach's car with the windows rolled down and the stereo turned up. Lifting her sunglasses, Gracie grabs Zach's arm and peers at his watch as he slurps down a large orange soda.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What's with the fretting face?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Waiting for Morri to turn up makes me nervous</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Taking a huge bite out of his sandwich) True</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You know, we're about to look at a bunch of dead guys, is eating a meatball sub such a wise idea?</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="127" w="250" src="assets/images/y1c16_sammich.gif" a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Ah, I can handle it... I'm a man!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yes, your dangling Gumby air freshener totally screams that</p>

<div class="stage">A white car passes by, causing Gracie to crane her neck.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Mouth full) Would you relax? - she'll be here, you just called her on the cell phone five minutes ago</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I know but that girl is a lightning rod - she's been here, what, a month? - and look at all the weirdness that swirls around her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Speaking of lightning rods, has your contact had any luck with that footage from the train wreck?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Not much, they're still trying to enhance it - we do know for sure that this person... creature... has one serious stick toy that I do NOT want to be on the other end of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Huh, I wonder if there's a connection with this thing to the museum heist?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Crunching on some potato chips) I certainly wouldn't be surprised</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Think the cops still suspect M&amp;M?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I doubt it - the bank's security camera captured her chasing that hooded guy and, even if she were triple-jointed, there's no way she could knock herself out like that - besides, the Duquesa's Tears were recovered</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Groaning) DON'T REMIND ME - I had to write sickening articles all week on &quot;Captain Phelps' remarkable recovery of the stolen necklace&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> His words?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> One of ten &quot;Crunch Quotes&quot; offered up in the Coast Guard's press release</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Groovy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> If that toad-frag trumpets his do-gooding one more time, I'm going to hurl</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Just do it on his shoes, not mine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What I can't figure out is why the thieves didn't make off with the emerald or at least a couple of the pearls? - why is the clasp the only thing missing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Maybe it broke off during the chase?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I don't know, the whole thing is freaky</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's why we need to spend our afternoon sneaking around in the morgue, checking out corpses</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Are you going to finish that pasta salad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Handing it to him) I just hope we're done in time - Sig7 is new tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Big deal, it's only a clip show</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I got a few nasty e-mails from some of the &quot;Siggies&quot; - seems our JPEG of Ursula at the museum ball was not &quot;flattering enough&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Spitting food) FUCK'EM - let them take the damn pictures and do the damn website!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Where in the hell is Morrigan?</p>

<div class="stage">There's a long, awkward silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Oh, did I tell you I'm thinking of getting the Chinese symbol for &quot;mom&quot; tattooed on my hand?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Just be sure it's not the one you use to beat off with</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> LOVELY THOUGHT, GRACE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I thought so</p>

<div class="stage">Isaacson pulls out a piece of paper with a bunch of characters on it and hands it to Takanachi.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Pointing to a character) I actually like the way this one looks but I have no idea what it means</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Folding up the paper and handing it back to him) Zachary, you've known me for two years - I am not Chinese, I am Japanese, and even if the characters WERE in Japanese, I STILL wouldn't be able to help you out because they did not teach me Japanese in my Washington State public school</p>

<div class="stage">A tall, thin man with glasses saunters out of the coroner's office and takes off in his SUV.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Watching) That's Justine's boss, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Yep - that's our cue to head on in</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="93" w="288" src="assets/images/y1c16_coroners.jpg" a="middle"/>


<div class="stage">As the two get out of the car and make their way across the street, Morrigan zooms around the corner and pretends to run them over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> HA, very funny - BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What took you so long?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Zach gave me directions</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Actually, I just had to make a not-so-quick stop at the post office</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> No mysterious packages handed off to you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No evil band of letter carriers reciting poetic warnings?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nope, it was all very uneventful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's a first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Let me go park and I'll meet you two inside</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Gracie and I are taking bets on whether or not you toss your cookies</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Softly) I've seen death before</p>

<div class="stage">The two watch as the white Mustang speeds off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Sighing) I really like Morri but she is just way too creepy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> That's a high compliment coming from a woman with eight fingers and a tattoo of gigantic eye above her cooch</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie soft-kicks him in the butt as they go inside. Justine Mirabello, the assistant coroner and best bowler on their team, struts down the hall wearing her scrubs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> ZACH... you're late!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Uh, we were waiting for your boss to leave</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> That was five minutes ago</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at a wall clock) Technically, it was 6 minutes and 22 seconds ago</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Do you know what kind of position I put my ass in to sneak you two in here?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Zach glance at each other and try not to smirk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Yeah, that's real mature</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Thanks, Justi, we really do appreciate this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> YOU BETTER - by the way, I had dinner with Trevor the other night, he took me to Le Petite Bistro</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Great, I hope you two had a good time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Guess where I want you to take me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (All excited) CHUCK E CHEESE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Le Petite Bistro</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> LE PETITE BISTRO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Well, Trev is middle management, he can afford to take you to Le Petite Bistro - I am a starving newspaper reporter, I can afford to take you to Le Petite Burger King</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan walks in and joins the trio.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> KJ wants to take me to that bistro restaurant, I hear it's wonderful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Scowling at Zach) Who is she?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Extending her hand) Hi, I'm Morrigan McBride - you must be Justine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Still scowling at Zach) Did I say you could bring friends?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You said he could bring me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> You don't count, Takanachi - look, I am not selling tickets to the circus here - you've just upped the chances of me getting fired</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I can assure you, Ms. Mirabello, I will not divulge you as a source...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> SAVE IT - we have an hour before my boss gets back</p>

<div class="stage">The assistant coroner pulls Zach down the hall with her as Gracie and Morrigan trail behind them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Aside to Gracie) They make a cute couple</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It will never be anything more than casual because Zach is intimidated by her superior intelligence</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How do you know she's smarter?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> She's a member of Mensa... and she has &quot;Superior Intelligence&quot; as her personal e-mail</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's great - good for her!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Is there ANYONE you ever find fault with?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking off) One or two...</p>

<div class="stage">All four are now in the main lab. Zach and Gracie react to the smell as Morrigan observes every aspect of the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Pulling off the covers to the bodies) Ms. McBride, I apologize if I came off as a little snippy - I've had to deal with incompetent co-workers all day, the irresponsibility of my sister, and, unless it's a bouquet of flowers, I don't really care for surprises</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I understand completely - I assumed that Zach was going to tell you I'd be here</p>

<div class="stage">Both women give him a dirty look.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Looking at Justine) If I had told you, would you have agreed?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Got me there - GRACIE, PLEASE DON'T PLAY WITH THE LIVER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Poking at the organ on a tray) Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Oh, I forgot to mention, Zach, your idiot friends - Russ and Gina - didn't even have the decency to include me in their wedding - I set them up, after all!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's horrible - if it weren't for you, there wouldn't be a wedding</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> THANK YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Oh my God, I'm going to be sick</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Is it the blood?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> No, the female bonding</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> These are the five bodies that were brought in the night of the museum heist</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Five?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> The woman on the left was found floating in the bay, she had on the same clothing as the four male victims here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> She was one of the guards?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> You say that like she couldn't have been</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Don't get me wrong - I'm all for equal opportunity - equal opportunity DEATH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How did she die?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> She had a cyanide capsule embedded in her tooth, crunched it open and took her own life</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Sweet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Why would she kill herself over some stolen jewels?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> She didn't want to give up her employer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> C'mon now, your life for a stupid necklace?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> A very expensive necklace</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Not THAT expensive to off yourself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe if she didn't, someone else would've done it for her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking closer at the body) What are those scratches there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> She was apparently in some kind of scuffle - we calculated it to be right around the time of death</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Growing uneasy) Do you know what made those marks?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Not yet but all of these victims have them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What about the dudes?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Pointing to a male body with its head dissected) We call this one &quot;Typical I&quot; because he was killed by multiple gunshots, a main one to the back of the head</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Someone didn't want him talking</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> And this one over here is &quot;Typical II&quot; - he just had his neck snapped</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Oh, is that all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What about the other two?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> &quot;Anomaly &amp; Conundrum&quot; - my names for them - well, they're a little bit different</p>

<div class="stage">Justine goes over to the first body and looks at a chart.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> &quot;Nommy&quot; was apparently hurled into the courtyard and landed on his skull - not a good thing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> How do you know someone threw him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> The angle and force of impact - there's no way a simple fall could have done that kind of damage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What about a blunt object?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> A blunt object that has the same pattern of cement that cracked his head open? - no, he was definitely hurled... with the same velocity someone hit by a car would be</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> How is that possible?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking at his hand) And why is his wrist crushed?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Hello, that's why we call him Nommy!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Going over to the other man) What about this one?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Admiring his lower section) What a waste!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> &quot;Conny&quot; here is even more bizarre - he was thrown UP and impaled on a spiky metal sculpture... I always hated that sculpture - anyway, this is what we usually see in the South when people are skewered on tree branches and on church steeples from a tornado</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Maybe he fell from the museum roof onto this thing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Nope - the roof is nowhere near this sculpture, it's physically impossible for him to fall onto it - we did the math</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Then who... or what did this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> &quot;Magic PCP Man&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> That's the excuse my boss wants to use - even 10 guys amped on an adrenaline rush could not do this - AND there are no traces of Phencyclidine in any of their systems</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why would you agree to this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I like my job and these guys were all killed in a very grotesque way - I do not want to be killed in a very grotesque way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Turning his head) What about... ooh</p>

<div class="stage">The smell and sight finally catch up to him. In a delayed reaction, Zach loses his lunch all over everything. Watching her buddy causes Gracie to do the same.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Dry heaving) YOU JUST PUKED ON THE EVIDENCE, GOD</p>

<div class="stage">The two run out of the room, down the hall and into the restrooms as Morrigan remains with Justine.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Trying to catch her breath) What, do you have a stomach of steel?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Calmly) This doesn't bother me - what bothers me is the similar characteristic these victims have - a characteristic they most likely share with the three men found on Celoso Beach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Growing nervous) What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I want to take you to Le Petite Bistro</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Uh, thanks, you seem like a nice girl and all but I like Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It would be repayment for a favor I'm about to ask of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> In that case, does next Tuesday at 7:00 work?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Fine - I am guessing these victims have traces of a slimy, scaly substance - a substance also found on the Celoso Beach victims</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Jaw dropping) How do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm having some tests done by a contact at SCU - I want to compare his results with yours on this substance</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Huh, Santa Con is so inferior</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) That's why I need a woman of superior intelligence to help me out - do we have a deal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Absolutely!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Great - oh, and not one word to Zach or Gracie on this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> You're out to out-scoop Zach, I LOVE IT</p>

<div class="stage">The two chuckle and head down the hall where they meet up with a still-queasy Isaacson and Takanachi.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Hands on her hips) Because of your weakness, I am going to have to clean up your mess before my boss returns</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> We owe you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> BIG TIME - my bathroom needs painting, clear a weekend!</p>

<div class="stage">The assistant coroner opens the door for them and they file out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> It was nice meeting you, Morrigan, I'll see you around</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks for all of your help, Justine</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Zach shuffle to their car with Morrigan following.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you two going to be alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I need a beer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I need a nap</p>

<div class="stage">A blonde, smiling woman in tap shoes clops over to them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hey, Joenne</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Hey guys, what are you doing here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> We came to see your sister</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Is she in a good mood?</p>

<div class="stage">There is a long silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Uh-oh, I was late with the rent check and I came over here with a partial payment - maybe now is not a good time?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> You know your sister, what do you think?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Sad face) You're right</p>

<div class="stage">She turns to face Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Hi, I watch you on the news</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Extending her hand) Morrigan McBride, nice to meet you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Shaking it) I'm Joenne Mirabello, Justine's twin</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan studies her face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Fraternal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> How do you like life in the Santa Conchita Valley?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's been... interesting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I bet - the beaches here are beautiful but you really should explore the mountain areas... lots of fascinating things to discover</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Raising an eyebrow) Hmm, I'll keep that in mind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> How was your dance class?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Actually, I'm on my way to it - I guess I'll deal with Justine later - cool meeting you, Morrigan and I'll see you two at bowling!</p>

<div class="stage">They all take off in separate directions.</div>

<i>Dear Aunt Cathy-</i>

<p><i>Thank you, thank you, thank you for the care package, it's really hard trying to find &quot;Bit-O'-Honey&quot; out here. I hope all is well in the Lone Star state, I miss you much and I miss Tallulah. There will be a three-day weekend soon so I can come visit you and bring her back with me. I have yet to approach my landlady about this but something tells me a woman who names her cats after supermodels and plays with crystals won't have a real problem with it.</i></p>


<p><i>It's been exactly a month now and I can safely say my time here has been vastly more chaotic than most of my days in Montana. Returning to typical California weather has been wonderful and it's great being only hours away from dad instead of states.</i></p>


<p><i>My job at KCON is working out pretty well so far. Your normal office politics but nothing I can't handle. My co-worker Gracie is turning into one of my best friends, along with a fellow journalist, Zach (although they can be a bit suffocating at times). They're heavily into the Sci-Fi scene and keep trying to drag me into it. There's no need since I feel like I'm living in my own creepy adventure. It's too much to explain now but I'll tell you all about it when I see you.</i></p>


<p><i>Finally, I met a nice guy named KJ von Meer. He's very handsome, very rich, and very hung up on a married woman. He's good for companionship but I don't see it leading anywhere beyond that. His father is sweet enough but his mother is an elitist snob. The sister is a real case. She has everything - beauty, brains, wealth, and health - and hides away in a lab. Such a shame, she's a total puzzle just like a lot of things in this town. Yet, the funny part is that it seems like I was meant to be here, and I don't know why.</i></p>


<p><i>Y'all take care now!</i></p>


<p><i>Love,<br>
