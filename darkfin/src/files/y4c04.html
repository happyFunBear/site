<div class="stage">Six months after the Bay Valley Medical Center explosion&hellip;</div>


<div class="stage">Across the street from KCON is the &quot;Brews &amp; News&quot; coffee shop. Looking spectacular in her pomegranate jacket and matching lipstick, Kylee Shepperton clip-clops her way along the intersection. Two men fall over their espressos hoping to attract her attention as she hurries past the umbrella area of the sidewalk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Excuse me, Ms. Shepperton&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee freezes and scans around half-empty tables for the voice. It belongs to an African-American teenager in the corner. She is in a wheelchair.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Hi, I'm Brianna Watkins from East Chaparral High - we were supposed to meet at 11:30?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Oh&hellip; oh, okay &mdash; great, let me get a mochaccino and I'll join you in a minute, Sweetie!</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee flashes her signature shine smile and ducks inside the shop. As she stands in line, she furiously punches the pad on her cell.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Angered hushed tones into phone) Phil, PHIL &mdash; what in the hell are you doing to me? &mdash; you set up this ridiculous mentorship thing, the least you could have done is find a mini-me to work with - this girl is NOT a mini-me&hellip; I am so gonna get you for this, Phil</p>

<div class="stage">Moments later, Kylee emerges from inside with two extra large cups and takes a seat at Brianna's table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Sorry for bein' late &mdash; newsroom business and all</p>
<p a="center"><img src="../assets/images/y4c04_kylee.jpg" alt="" h="645" w="745"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> If I were a source, would you have been late?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Heh, here's a mochaccino for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Sorry, I don't drink coffee</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Oh, Honey, you will in this industry - might as well learn how to swallow now</p>

<p>Kylee gulps down half her cup.</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> So&hellip; I'm sorry, what is your name again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Brianna Watkins</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee gently takes her hand in hers and pets it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Nice to meet you, Ms. Watkins &mdash; I'm Kylee Shepperton, KCON's lead anchor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Yes, I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I know, too, I just love sayin' it out loud &mdash; did you know they rebuilt the entire NewsCenter8 set for me? &mdash; the new one features colors and woods that better accentuate my eyes and skin tones</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I did not know that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> And I love the name Brianna, it's so sweet &mdash; it's today's name what &lsquo;Jennifer' was in my day and what &lsquo;Brandy' was in my momma's time &mdash; y'know, I was almost a Brandy but my bitchy aunt took it for her youngin' &mdash; thank the good lord because Brandy Shepperton sounds like a beverage and we just had an in-house memo not too long ago about losing female talent with too-cutesy names &mdash; now they want us all to be smart and professional sounding with a little bit of ethnic flavor thrown in&hellip; I mean, flava, yo</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> How many cups of coffee did you have before this one?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> We get little love notes from management &mdash; &quot;stripes are not your friend,&quot; &quot;that hairdo makes you look fat,&quot; &quot;lose the disco belt,&quot; &quot;too much lip gloss looks like lube,&quot; &quot;you're slouching too much&quot; &mdash; it's like a daily dose of momma in a memo</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Should I be writing this down?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Shocked) Can you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> My legs don't work but everything else does, including my brain</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Do you need a diaper?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> No, and it's called a catheter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> What about&hellip;</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee peers around and leans in closer to Brianna.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> What about your hooha?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I think the AP Style Book refers to it as a vagina</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Can you have sex?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> It doesn't just have to be between the legs &mdash; a simple touch anywhere in my upper body is stimulating</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Oh my, I hope when I shook your hand earlier, you didn't mistake it for foreplay?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Um, no</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I just don't do black people, women, or the physically handicapped &mdash; emotionally handicapped is another story &mdash; anyway, all three of y'all at once would be a whole new world for me and I ain't done with this one yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Back to the reason we're here&hellip;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> That's right, I'm your sponsor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Mentor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Right &mdash; you are gonna learn a lot from me, Missy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> What I've learned so far is kinda scary</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee takes out a pack of ultra lights.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I actually find cigarettes offensive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Lighting up anyway) You're already in a chair, what's a little smoke?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> And this is a no-smoking area</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee takes a long drag and blows it out away from Brianna.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Keep an eye on your really ugly man watch there and time how long it takes for someone to say something to me &mdash; I guarantee it won't be from the male persuasion</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Uh-kay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> So, tell me about yourself, Bree?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Brianna &mdash; I'm not a cheese</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Tell me something about yourself, Biotch?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Only if you promise to stop being all down with the teen slang &mdash; it doesn't work for your flat, white ass</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee mock smiles while extinguishing her lit butt in Brianna's cup.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> FYI, I'm an editor at my high school newspaper and I also run a student rights blog</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> A blog, how quaint</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> It's not quaint, it's the future - you aren't owned by a corporation and you can express yourself with total transparency, unlike today's media</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Oh, Darlin', please - everyone one, including you, always has something to promote and something to hide - there is no such thing as absolute transparency &mdash; except maybe in the case of plastic wrap&hellip; mmm, that reminds me of a time in D.C.</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> (Interrupting) Just so you know, I'll be writing an article on our meeting, you might want to keep your NC-17 stories on the down low</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Like I could ever compete with y'all &mdash; I saw the movie &quot;Kids&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> We're not all like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Riiight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> If you and the media in general stopped encouraging stupid stereotypes, maybe we'd be better off as a society?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> You know what you are to society, Rihanna?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Brianna</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> You're a triple token</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> A triple what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> A triple token &mdash; you got the gender/non-Caucasian/disabled thing going for you &mdash; Honey, become Jewish and make it beyond impossible to be fired</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I can't even believe what I'm hearing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Do I need to speak up? &mdash; I thought you said your head was fine?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> My head is fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Actually not &mdash; we're seriously gonna hafta do somethin' about your hair, especially if you have broadcast aspirations</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I have serious journalism aspirations, not newsmodel ones</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Also, you might want to consider more vibrant colors for your complexion &mdash; and don't they have sexy wheelchair accessories now? &mdash; you should match your nail polish to your spokes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Wow, just wow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Do that again!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Open your mouth really really big</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I wanna see how wide you can git it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Whyyyyyyy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Listen, 90% of the female anchors and 75% of the male ones you see on network and cable are there mainly because of who they blew and/or are blowin'</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Speak for yourself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I am, now you need to pay attention, Miss ADD &mdash; blowin' doesn't just have to be with the corporate owner suits, it can easily be with those with financial or political favors to a partner of the corporation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> What about the non-blowers, how did they get their jobs?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> They're usually some mega-rich person's daughter or nephew or godchild</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> None of them got there because of their brains or reporting talent?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Oh sure, there are a few of those &mdash; we call them &quot;the exceptions&quot; &mdash; McBride was a good example of that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> She was awesome, whatever happened to her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Don't know, don't care &mdash; back to me &mdash; what were we sayin'?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Blowers and non-blowers?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Ah yes - it's all a commodity &mdash; of course, it's always been that way for us gals in any business &mdash; a woman's two main jobs have always been momma and whore way before the Bible</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Times have changed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Not really, when you truly think about it&hellip; not really</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Funny, the news director at KCON's rival station is a woman</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Have you not been paying attention to the blowin' part of my presentation?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> She's married with kids</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Sugarpie, that is the biggest front out there &mdash; you have so much to learn, so shut your yap and listen up!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I thought you wanted my mouth open?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> You know, I have to laugh at those CEO ladies who think otherwise &mdash; they are just a-foolin' themselves &mdash; see, I accepted this reality early on and I didn't try to fight it or ignore it and look how far I've come</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> That's spelled c-u-m, correct?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Are you gonna sit there and snark the entire time?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I was hoping to ask some real questions but I find all of this totally fascinating in a very sick way &mdash; please go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I'll give you this &mdash; they do occasionally trot out the nominal unattractive chick in broadcast to pretend like they believe in ladies with brains, print is full of &lsquo;em but that's a dying dinosaur &mdash; heh, we have one of them fugglies now at KCON, she's over 40, over 200 lbs., beady eyes like a Rottweiler, and does a special report maybe once a week on shit no one gives a crap about but we have to be representative</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> And didn't she just win a Peabody Award?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Now she has a round piece to add to her dildo collection</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Don't be such a hater!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> You're right, I am being a tad mean &mdash; I do have a couple of friends&hellip; well, I technically shouldn't call them friends since they are rivals and openly despise me &mdash; anyway, one has a masters from Northwestern and is basically doing fluff pieces</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> But that's how most women in the business start out, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> She's been doing it for 10 years</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Oh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> And the other friend is working on her communications PhD from Columbia and works behind the scenes at one of the major networks &mdash; they won't even consider her for on-air until she gets a nose job and loses about 50 shades of black</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Way harsh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> No offense, Honey, you're one of the pretty coloreds</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> True that!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Wanna know a not-so-secret secret? - the stations actively pimp out us gorgeous gals to the viewers so some sweaty loser with one hand on the remote and the other God knows where can watch and pretend he has a shot with us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I'm kinda thinking he does from what I've heard so far</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I'll tell you what - the next time you're on that blog thang of yours, take a look at the &lsquo;hottie anchor chick' fan sites - we are encouraged to have stalkers, it means that the coveted male demographic is watchin' and beatin' off to our images, it doesn't matter what comes out of our mouths as long as there is the fantasy and eventual reality of some guy putting his dick in it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> That sounds like a sweeps stunt in the making</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I know - it's just like Hollywood - no one wants to watch ugly people, fat people, or cripple people fucking&hellip; although you have a cute face, you might be able to garner a fetish following</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> So, basically I stand a better chance at success if I look like I was just unwrapped out of a plastic box from the Toys &lsquo;R Us aisle?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> See, you're learnin'</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> That's never gonna happen, so I'll need to rely on being extra smart and persistent</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Don't worry &mdash; stations hire these make-over artists now, they'll help you with everything from primping to proper posture &mdash; I, of course, never needed that because of what I learned in my pageant days</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Do they help you with anorexia, too?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Taking out another cigarette) I am so sick of hearing about this eating disorder shit &mdash; this is an actual fact that you can put into that article of yours &mdash; the camera doesn't add 10 lbs., it adds 15, especially on women &mdash; there is nothing wrong with being in shape, especially when you have to go before those cameras &mdash; enough already with the anorexia BS!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> What did you have to eat today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Besides endless cups of caffeine and cancer sticks?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Don't look at me like that, little girl &mdash; you of all people know sometimes&hellip; most of the time&hellip; we do what we need to do to in order to survive and not to make snap judgments based solely on appearance</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Like you did with me earlier?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Looking away) I did no such thing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Garden tool, I suggest you check yourself out in the longest mirror possible and see what kind of appearance you be projectin', a'ight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I can't believe I am having this conversation with a high-schooler who has to pee in a tube!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> At least I don't have tubes peeing in me!</p>

<p>For one brief second, Kylee grabs her beverage and considers throwing it at Brianna.</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> (Taking out her camera phone) Go for it, you'll be my ticket into the Massachusetts university of my choosing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I hope your wheels slip on the ice and a bus finishes off the upper half of you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Why a bus? - why not a Mercedes? - or a truck or a snowplow? - because I'm black, you instantly thought of a bus?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> No, no, I instantly thought of your bloody carcass in the middle of the asphalt, chica</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Wrong raza, chickenhead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> What, are you gonna school me now? - am I gonna hafta be bused?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> That's it, I'm putting in for a new mentor</p>

<div class="stage">Just behind them, four well-heeled elderly ladies enter the patio area. They are about to take a seat near Kylee and Brianna when they suddenly stop, turn their noses up at both of them, and strut over to the table at the far end.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Noticing) OH MY, I GUESS WE ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE A-SITTIN' NEXT TO THE BONIVA PATROL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Sistah, they're not good enough to be sitting next to us!</p>

<div class="stage">There is a brief moment of silence followed by Kylee sighing and Brianna chuckling.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Extending her hand) Truce?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> (Taking it) Truce</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Squeezing Brianna's fingers) Did I just get to second base?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> You need to buy me real food, first &mdash; none of this coffee house junk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I'm gonna run back inside and freshen up my beverage, do you want anything?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> When you come back, I'd like to ask more questions and, hopefully, get answers that I can actually print in my piece</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Getting up) You can print what I've said so far</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Highly doubtful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Can't or won't?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Oh, I absolutely can but my faculty adviser would go ape-shit, threaten to pull the piece and suspend me from the staff - and, when she'd call you to confirm the quotes, you'd deny saying any of it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Wry smile) You're smart as a whip, Cutie</p>

<div class="stage">Just before going back inside, Kylee turns around.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> But a real clever writer would find a way to get what I said out there without editorial repercussions</p>

<div class="stage">Moments later, Kylee returns with another cup of coffee and a slice of carrot cake.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Offering some to Brianna) Wanna bite?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> No thanks &mdash; I do want to ask you about the recent shake-up at KCON and the crazy happenings in our area over the last year?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I know it's been tough times lately but, in all honesty, I couldn't be at a happier place in my life</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Specifics, please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> All of the tragic incidents over the past several months have, for better or worse, given the Santa Conchita Valley, specifically Duquesa Bay, a name besides &lsquo;that city between Los Angeles and San Francisco' &mdash; kinda like what happened to Simi Valley after the Rodney King trial</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I'm not sure notoriety is the best publicity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I thought you said you were studying journalism?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Tell me more about your own experiences at NewsCenter8?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Eating the icing off the cake) Mmm lessee, I'm finally the lead anchor thanks to the sudden death of Grand Empress Claudia Steel and the retirement of that old goat that sat next to her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> (Picking at the cake) Sounds like you're still grief stricken</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Ooh, and the network is grooming me for the national morning show in a few years, I just bought myself a top-of-the-line Mercedes, my closest on-air rival is totally out of the business now, and her pain-in-the-ass producer has fled to an island &mdash; HOO RAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Do you have time for a personal life?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> More than you think but I don't need one right now - my &quot;boyfriend&quot; hasn't bothered with me in months - I don't know if he's gone back to his wife or found someone else</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I could look him up on MySpace for you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I don't think he's on there &mdash; and I really don't care, no more need for the bruise-concealing foundation&hellip; ha ha, just kidding</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> For your sake, Girlfriend, I hope you are</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> When I first started in this business after becoming Miss Alabama, I thought I'd stay in it a few years until I married a rich husband - but now I'm actually expected to do real work and, you know what, I kinda like it&hellip; and I'm not ready to get stretch marks on my tummy yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> (Flipping through her notebook) I did some checking on your internet stats &mdash; there were 194 comments made about your eyes, 53 references to your breasts, 107 involving your hair, 22 about your hands, 18 of which involved your fingernails, and daily posts about your wardrobe and jewelry selections</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Horrified) Only 53 comments about my titties, are you sure you counted that right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> I am the vice president of my school's calculus club</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Huh, guess it's time for a new bra then</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> There was also one positive comment about you graduating with honors with a communications degree&hellip; and that's because I posted it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Aww, that's so sweet, thank you &mdash; but, next time, could you post something positive about my titties, too?</p>

<div class="stage">Brianna can't help but smile and Kylee does the same.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> On second thought, I'm going to keep you as my &quot;mentor&quot; &mdash; we have a lot to teach each other</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Sounds like a plan - I can't believe I'm actually sayin' this but you make me miss Takanachi</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Someone who didn't like me very much</p>

<div class="stage">Brianna squints at the side of Kylee's mochaccino.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> Apparently, there's more than one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Hey, I thought we were getting along?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brianna</span> (Pointing) I didn't write that</p>

<div class="stage">The words &quot;YOU ARE NEXT&quot; beside Kylee's name are scrawled in black ink on the paper cup.</div>
