<div class="stage">Trying to enjoy their lunch at Jean Louis' by the Watergate Hotel, Lydia and Penelope Renselier speak with a prominent &quot;Beltway&quot; socialite.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> Lydia, I can't tell you how much my husband is looking forward to having George step up with the real power elite</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Under her breath) A step up or a kneel down?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Casting her daughter a harsh glance) Why, thank you, CeCe - George absolutely adores the Senator and is looking forward to their golf game</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Munching on some flat bread) Actually, he's really looking forward to the locker room</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> (Sipping her tea) I'm sorry, dear?</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia knocks Penny under the table with her crutch.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Saccharine smile) I do hope they have a smashing match today!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> I need to correct you, Penelope - it's referred to as a ROUND of golf, not a match</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> OH... ROUND... as in your LARGE, ROUND ASUMPH</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia quickly stuffs a scone in her daughter's mouth.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> So, CeCe, tell me more about your work with the Smithsonian?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> I'd love to, but first, I need to take a quick trip to the ladies' room - if you'll both excuse me</p>

<div class="stage">The two Renselier ladies watch the older woman flit across the room. Penny hurls something after her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Grabbing her hand) Penelope... do not use the pecans from your muffin as projectiles - either you eat them or set them daintily aside on your plate</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Huffing and folding her arms) At least give me her teacup so I can drool in it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Winking) Sorry, Honey, that's my department</p>

<div class="stage">This elicits a slight laugh from her daughter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> It won't be much longer, we just have some museum business to chat about and then we'll go meet your father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> Did you hear what she said about my hair?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Well, whatever did you expect? - you have red, white, and blue streaks in it - you look like Betsy Ross' nightmare!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> I was doing it to honor my father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> And he appreciates your attempt at patriotism, Sweetie, but, next time - how about wearing a simple lapel pin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Shrugging) I could wear it through my nose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Finishing her sandwich) Excellent</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> By the way, what makes you think I was being patriotic to THIS country? - England has red, white, and blue as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Yes, but your father is not looking to become a member of parliament</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> He might be happier there - you know what the say about Englishmen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Hush up, that old bitty is returning - we need to make a nice impression - and stop slurping your salad</p>

<div class="stage">Penny makes a face and silently mocks her mother's words.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> (Taking her seat) Oh Pippy - I just thought of something for you...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Biting her lip) Penelope</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> Right - my granddaughter goes to an exclusive tanning salon in Alexandria - I could give you her number and she'd be more than happy to help you rid yourself of that ghostly pallor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> It takes me about an hour each day to achieve this ghostly pallor - why would I want to get rid of it to look like every other Barbie bimbo sporting a shade of bronzed poo?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I WOULD LOVE SOME MORE TEA, PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> Lydia, I wanted to mention earlier how amazed I was by your presentation concerning your little museum in Duquesa Bay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Yes, the Chumash heritage display is a cornerstone of our... little museum - we're quite proud of it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> And you wrote all of the material yourself?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Now becoming agitated) Yes - my brilliant daughter assisted me with the legwork - hee hee - but I indeed wrote it... word for word!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Mrs. Wembley</span> (Applauding) Why Lydia, you can write, I am so impressed!</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/v17_penny_lydia.jpg" width="520" height="587" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Deepening her tone) Mrs. Wembley, Multiple Sclerosis is not synonymous with Mental Retardation - not only can I read AND write, I can do it better than 99.9% of the so-called healthy population out there, so, if you are done with your well-meaning condescension, Penelope and I will be on our way</p>

<div class="stage">Now riding in the back of a limousine, the two Renseliers remain silent for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Finally breaking it) Did you have to be so mean to her, mom?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I'm just sick and tired of all of these people treating my brain like an invalid when it's only my body that deserves the reputation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Playing with her bracelets) They just don't get it and they never will... until it happens to them or someone close to them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> They're adults with an education supposedly past sixth grade, they should be able to grasp this rather simple concept</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Patting her mother's hand) Nothing with you is ever simple, mom</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia kisses her on the head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> Did you take your pills today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Not yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Raising an eyebrow) Can I have them, then?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Wrinkling her nose) Don't be snarky - ooh, look, there's your father waiting for us!</p>

<div class="stage">With a slight grin and golf bag on his shoulder, George waves.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Getting inside the limo) Did you two have a good lunch with Senator Wembley's wife?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Trying to reposition her cramping leg) Typical</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> I threw pecans at her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> That's not nice, Pen... did you hit her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> Nicked her shin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Good girl!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> How was your ROUND of golf?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Strategic - I met a lot of power players today - they think I have a realistic shot at a congressional seat in a few years</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> That's terrific, Geo</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> What's so great about here, anyway? - California is bigger than most countries - why can't you be happy there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I am happy there, but this is the progressive step that needs to be taken</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> Needs or wants?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Penny</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Scratching his head) A couple of the men I spoke with today are really interested in your brother's new venture</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Douglas has been so secretive about it, I'm not even sure what it involves</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> It involves money and it involves power - the perfect combo for this town</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> True enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Hesitant) And... as a result... I have been invited to one of their private clubs later</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/v17_george.jpg" width="420" height="589" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> DAD - THAT'S NOT FAIR</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I'm sorry, Honey</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Pouting) You promised me a tour of the National Cathedral and the Oak Hill Cemetery - those were the only reasons I came on this stupid trip!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Don't forget about getting out of your classes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I promise to make it up to you both - we'll do something fun tomorrow for sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> You have a heavy schedule of fund-raising meetings tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Staring out the window) You two can go to hell</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Pinching her daughter's leg) Already there, Darling</p>

<div class="stage">George tells the driver to pull over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> Listen, I'll catch a cab from here - you two go on and have a wonderful time, I'll meet you both for dinner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Kissing his cheek) Good luck, George</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Trying to kiss Penny's cheek) Daddy loves you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Turning away and sighing) Sure</p>

<div class="stage">The limo resumes its course. Penelope pulls out a small pad of paper and begins to scrawl wildly on it.</div>

<div class="stage">I wanna be anesthetized<br>
 Don't wanna look into your eyes<br>
 Don't wanna listen to your cries<br>
 I wanna be anesthetized<br>
 So tired of believing in your lies<br>
 So tired of being mesmerized<br>
 So your life can be sanitized<br>
 I wanna be anesthetized</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Wringing her hands) You know, while we're out here - why don't we check out Georgetown and George Washington University?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Wiping away a tear) Why would I want to go to college, especially a college that is on the other side of the country... who would wipe your ass?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Penelope, don't be crude</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> It's a valid question and it CERTAINLY wouldn't be dad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> We'll cross that bridge when we come to it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Softly) You can't even cross the street</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> With a little luck and the HARD WORK your father is doing now, hopefully, he'll be here in a few years - so, it only makes sense for you to go to school here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> And where will you be?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Most likely in the ground</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> I wish you wouldn't talk like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> But it is the eventual reality</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> It's ALL of our eventual reality - why can't we enjoy just one goddamn trip as a family?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> This is what your father wants in life and I expect you to support him in this, whether I am here or not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> What my father wants is that fucking faggot back at SCU</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia slaps her daughter hard across the face. Both are momentarily stunned.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> OH GOD, PENNY, GOD, I AM SO SORRY - HONEY, PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Pulling away) It's OK - I guess I deserved that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Tears rolling down her face) No, no you didn't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Unable to keep from crying) WHY DO YOU LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT? - WHY DO YOU LET HIM TREAT YOU LIKE THAT? - WHY DO YOU LET HIM TREAT US LIKE THAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> It's complicated, Baby</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> NO, IT ISN'T - HE EITHER LOVES US OR HE DOESN'T</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Trying to hug her daughter) He DOES love us, Penelope, HE DOES... just not in the way we want him to</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Low whisper) He loves himself more</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I won't attempt to argue with that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> How in the hell did you ever fall in love with him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Bemused smile) Honestly, I don't really know... but I did</p>

<div class="stage">Penelope looks to her mother and reluctantly pats her hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I was always considered to be &quot;damaged goods&quot; by men, your father was the first one to treat me with respect... to actually regard me as a sexual person</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> I'm not sure I want to hear this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> You need to hear this - when I first met George, it was very obvious to me that he was bisexual but we still fell in love, we hid behind... and within each other - do you hate me for bringing you into this mess?</p>

<div class="stage">Penny is momentarily stunned by the question.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> You know, if you ever wanted to find your natural parents, I wouldn't blame you in the least</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> No and no... no, I don't hate you - it's not your fault, I suppose it's not anyone's fault - and no, I have no need to find my DNA donors - for all of your fucked-up-ness, you and dad ARE and always WILL BE my real family</p>

<div class="stage">The two share a long, warm embrace.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Heh, here I was thinking I could save this darling 
 little baby they put in my arms and she is the one who ultimately 
 ended up saving me</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Kissing her mother's cheek and smiling) An indentured servitude of 18 years</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Playful tone) That's right, slave, now BUFF MY NAILS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> Yes, master - can we still go to the cemetery later?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Of course, but how about we go shopping first... ON YOUR FATHER'S CREDIT CARD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> YAY</p>
