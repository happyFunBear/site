<div class="stage">With the fierce storm abating, Morrigan and Amy drag a lifeless Darkfin over to an area of the beach that is not in plain view. Morrigan drops to Aleta Oscura's side as Amy recoils in wonder.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> That's... that's her - it - your friend, right?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan ignores Amy and places her left hand over Darkfin's still heart.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> She's so beautiful... and frightening at the same time</p>

<div class="stage">With her right hand tilting Darkfin's head back, Morrigan covers her mouth with her own and begins to slowly breathe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Is that going to work?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan continues to take long, measured breaths as her hand dimly glows in the middle of Darkfin's chest.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (In her mind) Yes, I heard you - now, you need to hear me - breathe with me, Fin, I know you're in there</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin's whole body begins to twitch and tremble.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> She's a fish, shouldn't she be in the water to breathe?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan now feels a slow but strong heartbeat. Darkfin's arms come up and wrap around her body.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) There you are</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin opens her eyes and draws Morrigan closer to her. They are breathing in perfect unison now.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My turn to play rescuer now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Raspy) Stay with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not going anywhere</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, Darkfin violently rolls both of them to the side. She springs up in a defensive posture, shielding Morrigan and bearing her teeth at Amethyst.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA, AMY</p>

<div class="stage">Holding the trident and taking direct aim at Darkfin, Amethyst considers the situation.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y3c19_df_amy.jpg" alt="" h="610" w="610"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I'm sorry, Morri, but this is the weapon I've needed all along</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Think about what you're doing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Believe me, I am - I either kill you two and present this to The Clergy as the ultimate trophy... or I finally kill my Father with it</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin calls to the trident but Amy has a firm grasp. The two struggle to gain control until it flips out of Amy's grip and lands directly into Morrigan's hand. She swings the balled end around and slams it directly into Amy's stomach. The wind is knocked out of her and she collapses to the sand. Darkfin juts out her armfin and is about to slash Amy's throat until Morrigan pushes her aside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin hesitates.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Tilting her face to meet hers) Look at me, Fin, no more killing...</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin is still tense until Morrigan pulls her into a lingering embrace.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> There's been far too much of that</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin returns the hug but does not let Amethyst out of her sight.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> She is a threat</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not anymore</p>

<div class="stage">Both Darkfin and Morrigan are reluctant to part from each other. Morrigan hands over the trident to Darkfin and then searches Amy's pockets for the car keys.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Finding them) Let's go</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan throws Amy's jacket over Darkfin's shoulders and the two hurry to the car. Darkfin loads the trident into the trunk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Climbing in the backseat) Where are we going?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Anywhere you want... as long as I'm with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Bay Valley Medical Center</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Back at the Techtonic nightclub, Jason hobbles over to Gracie and Jeremy.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What are you doing here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Super serious) I said we need to talk and I mean it!</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy protectively steps in front of Gracie.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What happened to your leg?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> I aggravated an old sports injury</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Right - are you sure it's not one of your constant mystery injuries?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Growling) I'm not here to talk about me...</p>

<div class="stage">Jason grabs Gracie's arm and pulls her towards the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> Let's go outside</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> HEY</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy shoves Jason off of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> BACK OFF, CLARK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (In his face) THIS IS NOT YOUR CONCERN, BOY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Right back in his) WHO ARE YOU CALLING BOY, BOY?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie now separates the two.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> BOYS, KNOCK IT THE HELL OFF - now, Jason, if we need to talk, you ask me nicely, I'm not some geisha girl you command - Jeremy, I appreciate the bravado but I can take care of myself!</p>

<div class="stage">Both guys reluctantly back down.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Now, I'm on my way home, if you want to talk to me, Clark, tag along but I'm warning you right now, I'm in no mood for BS - Colvin, I'll call you later and thanks again!</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie storms out the door. Before Jason follows her, he turns around to Jeremy.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y3c19_jeremy_jason.jpg" alt="" h="417" w="510"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> You watch your step with me, Brownie - you need to learn respect</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy bits his lip until Jason is gone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> And you need to learn how quickly I'm gonna kick your ass, Blue Boy</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie already has the engine running as Jason gingerly gets into the passenger seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> Ow - why did you rent such a piece of crap?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Driving off) Didn't you get the KCON memo? - I'm currently without a job and that means no moolah - this is what no moolah gets you in rental cars</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> I can try to help...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hold it right there - listen, Jason - I appreciate you looking out for me but it's got to stop - I'm still trying to figure out what happened between us that night...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Smiling at her) That was a great night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Frustrated) Maybe - I wish I could remember - but whatever happened, it happened and now it's over</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> It doesn't have to be over</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yes, it does - we're co-workers, that's it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> Technically, not anymore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> JASON - it was a one night stand - and that's all it's every going to be</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> If you gave it... if you gave us a chance</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> NO - I don't know how to say this without hurting your feelings but I'm just not that into you - let's try putting it into jock terms... you took your shot, the ball bounced off the rim, now it's time to pass to someone else</p>

<div class="stage">Jason grabs her knee.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Smirking) The ball bounced off of more than just the rim - you enjoyed the slam dunking, Takanachi</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Throwing his hand off) I'm not saying I didn't but the GAME IS OVER</p>

<div class="stage">Jason's face now contorts into sheer rage.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> IT'S BECAUSE OF ISAACSON, ISN'T IT? - I SHOULD HAVE...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Nervous) Should have WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Regaining control) Nevermind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Look, none of this matters anymore - Zach, KCON, you - I'm leaving Duquesa Bay and I'm not sure I'm coming back</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie pulls the car over to a bus stop and motions for Jason to get out. He grudgingly does. She speeds off down the road.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> You aren't going anywhere, Gracie, trust me</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Most of the injured from the Meeramar tanker are brought to the Bay Valley Medical Center. Anita checks in on a semi-conscious Craig. His nurse is very familiar with Anita.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> How's he doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> Drifting in and out - the doctor should have his results back soon... and how are you doing? - I haven't seen you in awhile</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Clearing her throat) I've been real busy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> Does she have a name?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Opening his eyes) Marcy - now both of you chatterboxes please be quiet because my head is ringing louder than a church bell</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Taking his hand) Craig - how are you feeling?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I guess you missed the church bell comment</p>

<div class="stage">Anita motions to the nurse to give them some privacy. The nurse winks at Anita on her way out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Aren't you tired of being a stereotype yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Chuckling) Life is too short to settle for one simple side dish at the buffet bar</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Even with Marcy as the main course?</p>

<div class="stage">Anita answers with a silent pause.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You know, you got the nickname &quot;Crunch&quot; for the number if sit-ups you could do, not for constantly cracking your cabeza</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Huh, I thought it was after the cereal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Seriously, Captain, you're worse than an NFL QB - keep this up and we're going to have to get one of those special helmets they strap on retards to keep them from banging their heads against the wall</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Smiling) Not very PC of you, Fiore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> When have I ever been? - besides, that's your job</p>

<div class="stage">Both suddenly become silent as they ponder their futures with the USCG.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Barely above a whisper) Craig... can you tell me what happened out there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> It's all so very vague - I can't really remember</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Do you know what happened to the tanker?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Searching his mind) I... I can't say - I do remember the Martel girl going overboard and diving in after her - and then the ship... I was slammed against it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> How were you able to hold on to little Hannah?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I don't... I don't know</p>

<div class="stage">Craig's eyes now widen as his face registers a shocked expression.#</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> It was Aleta Oscura, wasn't it?</p>

<div class="stage">Before Craig can answer, he slips back into unconsciousness.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Craig?</p>

<div class="stage">The doctor comes in and orders Anita out so Captain Phelps can get his rest. Anita walks out into the hall where she spots Penny Renselier and her dad. They are waiting for Lydia to get checked over. As George speaks with his wife's doctor, Penny goes over to a vending machine. Anita saunters over to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> We didn't have a chance to finish our conversation earlier</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> I'm sorry, you bitching at me is considered a conversation?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Rubbing her left wrist) I want to know exactly what happened to my captain... and I want to know what your deal is?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> I helped save your buddy and my cousin - end of story - as far as my deal, it's not your problem</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (In Penny's ear) I'm making it my problem and it will be a bigger problem for you if I have to haul your skinny goth ass before a Coast Guard commission</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> You forget who my father is - he will never let that happen - the only way I'm going before a commission is for them to pin a hero medal on me</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y3c19_penny_anita.jpg" alt="" h="510" w="510"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'll make sure they pin it through your nose if you don't answer my questions</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> That would be perfect, thanks</p>

<div class="stage">The Renselier daughter begins to walk away but Anita pulls her back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I spoke with Craig, there's no way an unconscious man scaled the side of a sinking tanker with a sick toddler in tow - and seeing you weren't IN the water, how did you manage to pull them both on board?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Evil laugh) Don't you believe in miracles, Lieutenant Fiore?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I believe in horseshit and that's exactly what's coming out of your mouth, mentiroso!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> (Finishing with the doctor) Is there a problem, lieutenant?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Backing off) That's up to your daughter, Mr. Renselier</p>

<div class="stage">KJ rushes down the hall and interrupts their conversation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Frantic) Have any of you seen my sister?</p>

<div class="stage">They all look baffled.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I haven't been able to find Erika since we were on the ship</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I can check the master list we complied as we docked - IF she was on one of our boats - when did you see her last?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> We were on deck when the storm hit and I went to help my mom through all the chaos - now I can't find Rikka!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Raising an eyebrow) Interesting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Erika is fine</p>

<div class="stage">Both KJ and Anita look at Penny.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I saw her a little bit ago as she was boarding one of the ships</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Very - in fact, she's probably around here somewhere - with all the people and the panic, just keep looking</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Thanks, I will</p>

<div class="stage">Anita stares at Penny quizzically as the doctor gives George the okay to see his wife. He steps inside the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Following) If you'll excuse me, I have to be with my mother - why don't you go find your own family and annoy them?</p>

<div class="stage">Before Anita can respond, Penny slams the door in back of her. Anita huffs and storms down the hall. She turns the corner and runs right into her Uncle Hector.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Tio?</p>

<div class="stage">He has a look of utter devastation on his face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Hector, what is going on?</p>

<div class="stage">Not far from him, Carmen sobs hysterically in Frank's arms.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> WHAT HAPPENED?</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside Amy's car, Morrigan drives very carefully so she doesn't attract attention. Darkfin huddles in the backseat, keeping the jacket over her head and shoulders. The last rays of a ruddy twilight pierce through the bands of dark clouds.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> How are you holding up?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Noticing a patch of skin on Darkfin's shoulder) I should be asking you that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I asked you, first?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Touching a tiny cut on her lip) Fine... except fish teeth don't feel like feathers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You know, when I said I'd take you anywhere you wanted to go, I was thinking more along the lines of Portland, maybe even Alaska - why are we staying here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Because we must</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's a clear answer - let's try this question - why Bay Valley?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It has the necessary supplies - I have been most negligent in keeping stock - the distractions lately... never cease</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, it would be nice to have a quick breather from all of this, pardon the pun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Thank you... for earlier</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My pleasure... I was just returning the favor, of course - you're still one up on me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I think we are more than even</p>

<div class="stage">They turn on the street that leads to Bay Valley Medical Center. The hospital is seen in the distance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> When you're in there, bring me back a pillow and a blanket - it doesn't look like I'll be staying at Ms. Hill's hacienda tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You should have let me take care of her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Please don't blame Amy, she's confused</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> And you are not?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not anymore - ever since Joe threw me into the river, I have been at peace</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You do seem... different</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I now have faith</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Are you going to start ringing doorbells?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, not like that, my faith is in the universe, not in the god of Christians or Muslims or any of the world's religions... they've become destructive instead of instructive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> So, no old man with a long white beard for you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, trust me, if god were a man, all men would have a dozen boobs, beer for blood, and we wouldn't exist</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> So, she is a woman?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nope, wrong again - we wouldn't have PMS and we would be in power if that were the case - it's beyond assigning a gender - that's for writers with a bias or who lack creativity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Hmm, you do know that science will always trump faith, no matter what it is?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Patting Darkfin's hand) I prefer to think we compliment each other</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> We shall see</p>

<div class="stage">People and press are swarming the hospital parking lot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Hitting the breaks) I think we should go somewhere else</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Pull into that alley across the way - I can make it inside through an underground sewer passage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> EWW - forget the pillow and blanket request!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan does as she is told. Darkfin gets out of the car and checks around to make sure no one is nearby. She returns to the driver's side and wraps Amy's jacket around Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> At the first sign of trouble, you leave, understood?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not leaving without you, not anymore, understood?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Then stay right here - I will be back in fifteen minutes</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan nods as Darkfin yanks off the metal grating cover and crawls inside. About five minutes pass. Morrigan suddenly notices the cover levitating off the ground.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What the...</p>

<div class="stage">It flies forward and slams through the windshield, nearly decapitating Morrigan. Slouched in her seat and covered in bloody cuts, she peers in back of her and notices a pack of blue hoods floating in her direction.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y3c19_hoods.jpg" alt="" h="432" w="510"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not again!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan scrambles out of the car just as it catches fire. She calls to the trident and it comes flying out of the trunk and into her hand before the car explodes. Morrigan dashes for the hospital with the hoods chasing after her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I am tired of running from you clowns!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan stops in her tracks and turns around to face them. Their glowing eyes stare at her for a moment. Morrigan braces for a battle but they quickly float past her and head straight for the hospital.</div>
