  <h1>Year 3, Chapter 7</h1><h2>Divining</h2>

<div class="stage">Speeding along in the KCON newsvan, an exhausted and 
 still baffled Gracie heads back to the station from the von Meer estate. 
 Kylee finishes up some notes from their last report.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Unbelievable</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> (Opening up some gum) Karl Sr. was on the young side 
 of old but he was still old - back in Alabama, they drop like flies 
 at his age
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c07_gracie-kylee.jpg" width="510" height="456"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's because two-thirds of their bodies are made up 
 of lard and tobacco</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Occasionally, we'll have the one that lives to 112 but 
 that's always on the side of the family we can't stand - I remember 
 this great uncle...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Let me stop you here - my original, guttural remark 
 of &quot;unbelievable&quot; was meant to be a general, throw-away comment 
 that was nothing more than an observation of this day's complete insanity... 
 not a set-up for sharing Shepperton family incest moments</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Would you like a piece of Dentyne?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Sighing and taking the gum) Thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> No, thank you - especially the way you slurped up those 
 little onion quiches</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Gritting her teeth) I didn't have any lunch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I wonder what makes people think the way they do? - 
 my husband just died, maybe I should put out some onion quiche?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I highly doubt Mrs. von Meer was the one doing the 
 cooking - they have, what, a dozen servants or something?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> That's true</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I feel really bad for KJ, I've never seen him so devastated 
 - and I feel like crap for intruding on his family's privacy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> He should be glad that we were assigned this story, 
 we were very respectful of all the von Meers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Good God, I actually agree with you - what is going 
 on today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> It's just too bad Erika is such a disappointment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Huh?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> It's not right that she's not married with kids by now 
 - poor Karl went to his grave without being a granddaddy - that's a 
 sin where I come from!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Remind me to never go there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I'm serious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Um, we're around the same age and neither one of us 
 is married with offspring?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Don't remind me... at least I'm trying to do something 
 about it - thankfully, my step-sister just gave birth to her fourth 
 so the pressure is off of me for now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> How come you're singling out Erika? - why not KJ?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Because, it's more acceptable for him to be a playboy 
 bachelor with his money and looks - but for Erika, with her breeding 
 and beauty, she doesn't have to struggle in a thankless job like we 
 do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I kinda like my career</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> That is not the point - the point is she should be married 
 to Griffin, having his children, keeping the family business and the 
 bloodlines growing - not playing around with sea urchins</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Did Martel give you that sound bite while you were 
 giving him head in the bathroom?</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee remains silent and snaps her gum.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Uh-huh... so, Erika can't play with fish but it's okay 
 for guys like KJ and Griffin to play around with bunnies?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I don't know... I'm tired and confused</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I know KJ is sweet on our little outlaw McBride but 
 I have no doubt with all the ladies in his past that there's an illegitimate 
 nest in his tree somewhere</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> You know, I have enough problems with my own personal 
 life, I don't even want to venture a guess with his</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Ooh, someone sounds like she needs to talk!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Oh God, why did I speak to her, why, why?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie sticks out her tongue.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Here, take your gum back</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Okay then, nevermind, I was just trying to be friendly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Ugh... I really need to talk to someone about this 
 - why does it have to be you?</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee rolls down the van window and screams across traffic 
 to a man in a convertible.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Hello there, my camerawoman-slash-segment producer can't 
 talk to me about something - it's most likely something sexual - do 
 you think you could talk to her instead?</p>

<div class="stage">A mortified Gracie punches the gas and they zoom down 
 the road.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> This day has to end, this day has to end soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Not for us, we have another assignment for 11:00</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> We just have to do a quick follow-up on the quake - 
 I figure we'll get a shot of you straddling the huge new crack in the 
 valley floor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Why not get a shot of me in front of some damaged buildings?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Everyone is doing damaged building shots - besides, 
 people love to see you straddle, ratings go up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> But it's dark outside?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> You forget, you are in the presence of the Queen of 
 Lighting - how do you think I get your damaged hair to look so soft?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> That's right, I'm with Takanachi the frustrated artiste 
 - Good Lord, Gracie, it's a two-minute package featuring dirt!</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie slams on the brakes and does a quick u-turn.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Fine, we'll do a damaged building shot, let's get this 
 over with</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> WAIT... I'm sorry - let's do the crack, I wanna do the 
 crack with you!</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie bursts into uncontrollable giggles. Kylee can't 
 help but join in.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Wiping the tears from her eyes) Oh, I so need that 
 - that was funny for no real reason - so we're sticking to the original 
 plan?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Yes, take as long as you need... I'm not too keen on 
 rushing home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Christ, we're back to the girl talk again... what's 
 wrong at home?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I just don't want to go - Turner has been acting strange 
 lately</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie gives her a look.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Even more so than usual - he's been disappearing in 
 the middle of the night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Um, he does have a wife and kids</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> They mean nothing to him... I dunno, these last few 
 days especially, it's as if something is in the air</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Start singing Phil Collins and I'll smack you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I'm glad work has been keeping me busy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Nothing beats the misfortune of others to distract 
 us from our own</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I just don't want to go home tonight - is that so wrong?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> No... I know the feeling, believe me - if you want, 
 we can split a room at the Holiday Inn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Eww, I was thinking more along the lines of the Del 
 Pilar</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Maybe YOU can afford that!</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie takes a back road to the location of the broken 
 earth.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> So, are you ready to tell me yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Tell you what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> The reason why you don't want to go home?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Taking a deep breath) I slept with Clark</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Clark who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> OUR Clark, Jason Clark</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> (Shrieking) OH MY GOD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> See? - that's why I didn't want to tell you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> HOW COULD YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> AT LEAST FAKE SOME SUPPORT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> That's just wrong!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Of all the guys to pick from, why did you do the nasty 
 with him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I honestly don't know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Was he good?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I don't remember</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Why, you dirty tramp!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Hello, Kettle, will you accept a collect call from 
 Pot?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I, at least, remember mine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I didn't know the human brain could count beyond a 
 million?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> I've never done it with a man of color before</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> You mean to tell me Turner is an albino? - what about 
 the other 2000 a month?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Enough with the jokes, Gracie, I set standards for myself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> What century are you living in, Shepperton? - more 
 importantly, what color am I?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Everyone considers Orientals to be honorary white folk 
 in this country</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Dear God... and just when I was beginning to slightly 
 like you</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie pulls the van off to the side of the road and 
 starts to set up the equipment. A jeep barrels down towards them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> Looks like someone else is after our crack</p>

<div class="stage">Both are astonished to see a harried Justine and Joenne 
 before them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Mirabello, do you know where Zach is? - I have been 
 looking...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> GET BACK IN THE VAN - GO, GO, GO</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne pulls out her machine gun and lets loose behind 
 her as several hoods float in their direction.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> WHAT THE HELL?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> (Running back to the van) Let's go with the damaged 
 building idea, Gracie!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> TAKE MY SISTER WITH YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> NO, JOEY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> I have backup coming for me - I can hold them off - 
 you three need to get outta here, NOW</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne rips a grenade out of her sack and hurls it back 
 at the hoods.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> What is going on here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> I'M NOT LEAVING YOU...</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne knocks her sister out with a quick butt to the 
 back of the head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> Can you teach me how to do that to my parents?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> Sorry, Justi - GRACIE, KYLEE, GET HER IN THE VAN AND 
 LEAVE, GOD DAMMIT</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Kylee drag the limp Justine into the van as 
 Joenne hops back into the jeep and heads right for the hoods.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Calling after) DOES KCON GET AN EXCLUSIVE WITH YOU?</p>

<div class="stage">An army helicopter swoops down overhead and fires off 
 several rounds just missing the van.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> (Pounding the gas pedal) WE'RE LEAVING, WE'RE LEAVING, 
 WE'RE SO LEAVING...I HATE THIS DAY</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Back at the SCU lab, Erika and Shelby stare at Javier.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> I really need to be picking up Calvin - I'll see you 
 two tomorrow</p>

<div class="stage">Before she leaves, Shelby gives Erika a soft hug.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Shelby</span> Please go home and be with your family, get some rest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Not until I find out what I need from Sandy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> What is it that you need, Rikka?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika remains silent as Shelby leaves the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> (Taking her hand and kissing it) I am so sorry about 
 your father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Snatching her hand away) Are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Could you please take a look in the electron microscope 
 for me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> What is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Choking back the rage) TAKE A LOOK</p>

<div class="stage">Javier reluctantly does.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> (Stunned) WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? - HAVE YOU BEEN GOING 
 THROUGH MY FILES?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> So you HAVE been working on this!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> Look, just because we're all in the same department 
 doesn't mean we need to be a part of each other's projects - you have 
 tons of experiments going on that you keep me, Shel and Tim out of the 
 loop on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Cool) Who hired you to work on this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> How dare you? - it's a personal venture that I...</p>

<div class="stage">Erika stride across the room in two steps, grabs Javier 
 by the throat with one hand and pins him back with the other.
</div>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c07_erika-sandy.jpg" width="510" height="376"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm not going to ask you again, Sandy</p>

<div class="stage">Javier chokes and gags until Erika releases him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> WHAT... IN THE HELL... IS WRONG WITH YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Your little personal venture is hurting someone I love</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> Who is it hurting? - I don't understand - I think you're 
 overreacting because of your dad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> EXACTLY - I need to isolate this toxin quickly and find 
 an antidote - I can do it on my own but it will take too much time... 
 help me or I will make it very ugly for you and your family</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> I don't understand where any of this is coming from 
 - he said it was supposed to be for a cosmetics agent</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> WHO, WHO IS HE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Javier</span> Griffin!</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Thrashing around his bedroom at the Quartz Lake Inn, 
 an agitated Joe Tiszo rummages through an old wooden chest.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joe</span> I cannot ignore it any longer... forgive me, my Lord, 
 for I have been a coward far too long!</p>

<div class="stage">He grabs a crystal necklace similar to Amy's and it glows 
 a bright orange in his hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joe</span> (Tying it around his neck) Time is running out for everyone</p>

<div class="stage">He now pulls a long, black robe out of the chest and 
 throws it on.
</div>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c07_hooded_joe.jpg" width="410" height="367"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Pulling the hood over his head) Pray for us, Deirdre</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Deep inside the caverns of the Kiyomis, Amethyst stands 
 back and watches helplessly as Morrigan is cornered. Several hoods converge 
 on McBride.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> AMY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> I'm sorry...</p>

<div class="stage">The white robed leader places a hand on Amethyst's shoulder 
 as Morrigan is quickly bound, gagged and carried off by the hoods.
</div>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c07_gagged_morri.jpg" width="510" height="456"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> You did well, my child</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> (Flinching) I hate you for making me do this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> Ultimately, it was your decision, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> Let Zach go, now!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> Not until the Marked One fulfills her purpose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> I brought her to you now give me Zachary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> Our deal will be completed soon - you are more 
 than welcome to watch</p>

<div class="stage">Amethyst tries to throw a punch at the leader but her 
 fist is caught in mid-air and it is squeezed to the point of bones crunching.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> Do not test my patience right now</p>

<div class="stage">The leader brushes Amethyst aside and walks away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> I WILL COME BACK FOR HER... once I take care of Zach, 
 I promise you this!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> Don't waste your energy, I highly doubt she will 
 survive the ritual</p>

<div class="stage">The leader disappears into the caverns as two brown robed 
 subordinates carry in a badly bruised and blindfolded Isaacson. They 
 pass by Morrigan on their way.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Slipping out of her gag) ZACH, ZACH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> (Muffled) MORRI?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> GET DARKFIN...</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can say another word, the gag is replaced 
 and she is quickly hauled away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> WHO?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach is smacked in the jaw and thrown into a cave with 
 Amethyst. Brown hoods surround them both.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> ZACH - oh, my baby, I'm so sorry - are you okay?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Amy? - is that you?</p>

<div class="stage">Amethyst takes the blindfold off and unties him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> What the fuck is going on here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> Shh, relax... can you walk?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I think so - why are you dressed like that? - hey, I'm 
 really sorry about the donkey prank at your birthday party last year 
 but this goes way beyond payback!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> This is not a joke</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Did I hear Morrigan? - is she here? - who are these psychos?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> (Whispering) Don't say another word, just be ready 
 to run</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> But...</p>

<div class="stage">The ground starts to tremble again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Not another earthquake!

<p> Amethyst (Tears running down her face) No... not an earthquake</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> What's that chanting?</p>

<div class="stage">Amethyst looks up to a small hole in the cave ceiling. 
 It is filled with nighttime stars.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> They have begun the invocation too soon, it will 
 bring even greater disaster upon us</p>

<div class="stage">Clenching her jaw and summoning her strength, Amethyst 
 waves her arm in a flourish. The brown robed guards go crashing against 
 the wall.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> HOW DID YOU...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> WHAT ABOUT...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> (Taking Zach's hand and pulling him) RUN</p>

<div class="stage">Around the cave floor, the leader's chanting quickens 
 and is echoed by a horde of blue robes. The center of the ceremony, 
 Morrigan lies motionless. She is wrapped in a thin gray sheet with her 
 arms and legs exposed. The mark on her foot begins to glow as do the 
 rocks around the cave.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> CARRY HER</p>

<div class="stage">Four blue robes take a hold of Morrigan and await their 
 next command.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> LET THE MARK LEAD US</p>

<div class="stage">Drawn by a magnetic-like pull, Morrigan's foot is now 
 the center of her gravity. It draws her and her captors slowly down 
 a dark path, a path that lights up with several never-before-seen symbols 
 that glow with intensity.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> (Uncontained glee) WE ARE NEAR, WE ARE VERY NEAR</p>

<div class="stage">A dazed and weakened McBride feels her body on fire, 
 her foot begins to bleed again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Fin...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> Aleta Oscura isn't here to save you this time, 
 child</p>

<div class="stage">All of the sudden, Morrigan's foot slams down hard on 
 the cave floor, sending a jolt that knocks down everyone but her. She 
 screams in abject pain as rocks and dust tumble around them. A low-level 
 metallic hum fills the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> HERE, WE SHALL DIG HERE</p>

<div class="stage">A blue robe rushes over to the leader.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Blue Robe</span> But the timing, Master - the timing is slightly 
 off</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> White Robe</span> I AM DONE WAITING - IT IS NOW MY TIME</p>

<div class="stage">Both are horrified at the sight of Morrigan gracefully 
 levitating upright from the floor. She floats peacefully up to a precipice 
 and into the waiting arms of Joe Tiszo.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joe</span> (Eyes glowing) IT IS NOW YOUR TIME... YOUR TIME TO DIE</p>
