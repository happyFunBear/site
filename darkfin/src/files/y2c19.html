<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> It is a valid assumption</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> answer the question</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> No, there is nothing mystical about me, I am my own kind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> as u have said b4 - what about The Clergy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> That, I cannot answer - they revealed themselves to me the night of the charity ball</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> no rumors about them before?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> Only rumors, nothing solid</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> i saw Joenne Mirabello tonight</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> In this country, yes - there are only two other sources in the world</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> where?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> I cannot tell you now</p>

<div class="stage">Overwhelmed with the need for sleep, Morrigan flips off her computer and barely makes it to her bed. She is out the minute she hits the pillow. Over the next hour, she is confronted with wild dreams. They include blurry images, muffled voices, symbols that don't make sense to her, and the last thing she feels is an overwhelming sense of coldness. She screams and opens her eyes. Standing at the foot of her bed is a naked Amethyst, wearing a solitary crystal around her neck.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Blank expression) You must come with me... NOW</p>

<div class="stage">Inside the Duquesa Bay Yacht &amp; Polo Club's main dining room, Zach finishes touring the small dance floor with Justine. They wave to KJ having dinner with his parents and return to their table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Sipping her drink) I must say, Zachary, I am very impressed - how did you ever get us in here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Trying to figure out what kind of bread he's eating) A source owed me a favor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> What's the occasion?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Can't I take a beautiful woman out for a decent meal?</p>

<div class="stage">Justine sits in silence and raises an eyebrow.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Sighing) OK, OK, I need some info</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (To the waiter) Another shrimp cocktail, please!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Sarcastic) Be sure to save some room for dessert</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Winking) Oh, not to worry, I will</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> So, now that you know my ulterior motive, can you please tell me about J...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Father Greg? - or should I say Father Greg's parts?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Stunned) Um... right, yeah, go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Impressed with herself) Actually, you should be glad that I'm here to tell the tale at all - I was nearly caught by my boss - thank goodness he had to stop and chat with big boob receptionist because it gave me the extra seconds I needed to get the body back in storage and look all innocent</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Chuckling) Justi, you never look, &quot;all innocent&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">Shooting a squinty-eyed glare at her dinner companion, Ms. Mirabello says nothing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Retreating into his salad) Ahem... please continue</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> As I was saying, once I got the padre back all snug in the fridge, I made up a random excuse as to why I was leaving early and went directly to the SCU lab with some tissue samples - Shelby Willis helped me out with the testing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Is it wise to get her involved with this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I trust Shel, we belong to the same Weight Watchers group</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> And that automatically grants loyalty?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> It's the same kind of loyalty you have for your pool-playing buddies</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Wow, are you ever screwed!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Bad example - how about this, we take tennis lessons from the lady sitting at the table to your left</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Craning his neck) Mrs. von Meer? - really?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Don't sound so shocked, I can do more than bowl, you know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Taking her hand and kissing it) I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> So, now that we've established Shelby as a trusted source, do you want to hear about our findings?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Absolutely!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> It turns out Father Gregory Porter is really &quot;Father John Doe&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Try to follow along, Newspaper Boy - here, I'll simplify it for you... he's NOT whom he CLAIMS to be</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> And whooom exactly would he be?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Good question! - I have no idea - the better questions are &quot;why does he have different body parts&quot; and &quot;how could he technically be over 200 years old?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Dropping his fork) WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Shhhh - we're in an exclusive club, a club I want to belong to someday, please behave appropriately</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Trying to find his voice) Those... those were some pretty powerful conclusions you came up with there, Justi, care to elaborate?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I know, and that's why Shelby and I went over them a half a dozen times and each time, the results were the same - this man, and I use the term lightly, has several different organs from several different people and yet they all worked harmoniously and without rejection... until...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Until what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I'm not sure - but the bullet was the least of his problems</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> How is this possible?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I wish I knew - but it gets even better... the bone sample we took, dates him at around 200 years of age</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Unreal!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Exactly! - and, of course, my boss is sitting on all of this information, I don't know who he's involved with or what his deal is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> You need to find out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Eh, no - that's your job, I want to keep mine - why don't you ask Morrigan? - she's the epicenter of this weirdness, maybe she knows something about &quot;the man&quot; she shot?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I don't think she shot him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Digging into her shrimp cocktail) Then, I don't want to find out who did</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Absently) Huh, and I just wanted to find out about Joenne</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Aghast) WHAT ABOUT JOENNE? - IS SHE INVOLVED WITH THIS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Shhhh - remember, you want to get into this club?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THIS CLUB...</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone turns around and looks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT MY SISTER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Justine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> TELL ME, ZACH</p>

<div class="stage">His cell phone starts to ring.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Answering it) Hold on... hello?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It's me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Where are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'm on my way back to KCON - when I wiped Morri's machine, I left some dummy files as a decoy and installed a tracker program to signal me when someone tried to access them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'm on my way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> NO, stick with Justine and try to find out some more info - I'll let you know as soon as I know something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'll be there in ten</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> ZACH</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> You are not going ANYWHERE until you finish about Joenne!</p>

<div class="stage">KJ and his parents watch as Zach and Justine rush out of the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Picking at her entree) I swear, the element the club is attracting lately is cheapening it by the second</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Chewing) Whatever you say, mom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> It's one thing for your sister to be antisocial and rude in a place like this but when commoners do it, that's just abysmal!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Staring at his pasta) Erika is rarely in a place like this these days</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Commoners? - are we in a royal palace? - behold, ye thin body and golden tan, thou art truly a serf in queen's robes!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Sweating) Son, please don't torment your mother with Elizabethan English at the diner table</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> I'd rather have him torment me with that instead of dating that troublemaker McBride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Sighing) Here we go again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Look, Griffin tells me that Meeramar is on the verge of something big, you need all of your focus on that, NOT this girl's constant problems</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Dad can handle it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Chugging his water glass empty) I want NOTHING to do with Martel's PCOC project, we need to keep Meeramar as far away from this mess as possible</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> THAT'S NONSENSE, KARL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Why do you say that, dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> BECAUSE... what he's... cough... getting into... wheeze... is going to... gasp... bring us all down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Concerned) Karl?</p>

<div class="stage">Takanachi arrives at the station and sneaks in the side entrance. She cautiously approaches the darkened newsroom floor and makes her way towards Morrigan's cubicle. She hears a light tapping on a keyboard.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Peering around the corner) CLARK - WHAT IN THE HELL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Jumping up) SHIT, GRACIE, YOU JUST GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Angry) WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MCBRIDE'S COMPUTER?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Forcing a smile) What are you doing here so late, G-sneak? - everyone's in studio</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> DON'T PULL ANY DIVERSIONARY BS AND ANSWER THE QUESTION</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Calmly) I'm just... I'm just trying to find something, that's all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Folding her arms) And what exactly would that be?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> I don't need to answer to you, Fingers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Do you want to answer to Gates?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Smirking) Is that a threat? - because if it is, I'm sure Turner would LOVE to find out who diddled around with this computer... and my money is on the one with the cute, squishy face standing before me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Aghast) How... wh... SQUISHY? - why do you think it's me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Casually glancing around) I don't see anyone else here, do you?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie sighs and tries to think of what to say.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> Look, if you must know, I'm trying to find out what story McBride was working on before she left - everyone here assumes it's a big one and everyone assumes that it's going to be passed along to Kylee if it hasn't already</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's not the only thing that's going to be passed along to Kylee</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> So, I figured I'd beat her and everyone else to the punch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why? - you're a sports reporter!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> And that's exactly the reason - you think I want to be stuck shouting final scores the rest of my life? - I want to be a real journalist</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You do realize you're in broadcast, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> Yeah... does Eyes have a job for me at The Beacon?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Are you ready to live on peanuts and drive a Geo Prism?</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Blushing) HEY, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE MAD AT YOU</p>

<div class="stage">For the first time, the two of them relax and chuckle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> Seriously, I know I can do this and do a great job with it, I just need to break out of sports and this story will hopefully be my ticket</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Um, you do know that Morrigan is on the verge of being carted off to prison?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Genuinely remorseful) Yes... and I'm real sorry about that - she seems like a sweet girl and if there's anything I could do for her, I would, but I also have to think of my career and the too few opportunities that are out there, especially for people like us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> I mean, Christ, no one is circulating out of these jobs anymore - no one can advance up as long as people like Henshaw and Steel have their asses parked there for eternity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Heh, did you hear about that anchor in LA finally dropping at 80?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> See what I mean? - I know it's a harsh move to pull on McBride but the game goes on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You could try doing what Shepperton does but I don't think Gates is your type</p>

<div class="stage">Jason covers his face and gags. Gracie suddenly notices a cut on his upper wrist.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Truth?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Holding up his right hand) Word</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You've been sporting some rather nasty bruises and cuts lately - what is up with that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Short pause) You know I like to play hard - my pick-up games get brutal, no question</p>

<div class="stage">As Gracie mulls over this response, the sound of the elevator interrupts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> NOW WHO?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Dammit, we're both going to get our asses kicked for being here - quick, let's hide in Ortega's cube and peek out over his Diana Ross dolls</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Following her) Good idea</p>

<div class="stage">Both are stunned to see a hooded figure float out of the elevator and head their way.</div>
