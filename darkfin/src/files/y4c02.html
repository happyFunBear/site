  <h1>Year 4, Chapter 2</h1><h2>The Eyes Have It</h2>

<div class="stage">Six weeks after the Bay Valley Medical Center explosion...</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> ...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen... POW</p>

<div class="stage">A taller opponent clad in matching headgear and boxing gloves staggers back for a brief moment and then rejoins the sparring inside a Chaparral Heights gym.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Dodging a punch and then countering with a flurry of his own) One, two, three, four, five, JUST LIKE THAT, ANOTHER HIT JUST LIKE THAT</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y4c02_zach.jpg" alt="" height="655" width="655" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Opponent</span> (Going down on one knee) JESUS, ISAACSON, THIS IS JUST AN EXCERCISE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> GET UP, GET UP YOU SHITBAG AND HIT ME, HIT ME, C'MON LITTLE GIRL &mdash; ARE YOU TOO SCARED TO HIT ME?</p>

<div class="stage">The opponent reluctantly continues.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, theta, iota... BAM</p>

<div class="stage">A cheap shot to the left kidney sends his opponent to the mat in agony.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> GETUPGETUPGETPUPGETUPGETUPGETUPGETUPGETUP, GET UP FAGGOT AND FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT ME</p>

<div class="stage">A gym supervisor steps in and shoves an enraged Zach to the corner. Two others jump into the ring and help the opponent to his feet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Supervisor</span> COOL IT, ISAACSON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Opponent</span> I don't know what your deal is, dude, but if you come at me like that again, I'll fucking KILL YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Trying to get in his face) WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, ASSHOLE? - DO IT, DO IT, DO IT</p>

<div class="stage">The opponent charges at Zach but the others stand in their way as a human barrier.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Supervisor</span> GET OUTTA THE RING, RIGHT NOW</p>

<div class="stage">Zach tracks the opponent into the locker room with his eyes as the supervisor keeps him close.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> IS THERE ANYONE IN HERE MAN ENOUGH TO FIGHT ME? ANYONE AT ALL?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach spots Craig Phelps doing curls off to the side.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> HEY CRUNCH, CARE TO SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> With my head history, I don't care to be the next Steve Young - find someone else, Zachary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I saw you downing shots last week at Muldoon's, you couldn't be too concerned about your health, Captain Morgan!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Supervisor</span> SHUT IT THE HELL DOWN OR I'M SHUTTING YOU OUT OF THIS GYM</p>

<div class="stage">He pushes Zach away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Supervisor</span> You have two choices - button that yap of yours and work it out on the bag or get the hell outta here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Just looking for a quality opponent...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Supervisor</span> That's not what you're looking for, Zach &mdash; I suggest you go elsewhere and find it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Screw you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Supervisor</span> (Quietly in Zach's ear) Because we're buds, I'm only suspending you for a week... pull this crap again, I'll not only get you banned from here but from every gym in Quartz County - understood?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) Chelsea, Arsenal, Aston Villa, Man U, Tottenham, Bolton, Liverpool...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Supervisor</span> IS THAT UNDERSTOOD, ISAACSON?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Walking off) Got it</p>

<div class="stage">Zach sulks off to the bag as the supervisor leaves to check on his opponent. Craig finishes his curls and makes his way over to Zach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Are you too much of a pussy to hold the bag for me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Doing so) Care to tell me about the new inhabitant in your sigmoid colon?</p>

<div class="stage">This comment causes Zach to catch his breath momentarily and then launch into a fist barrage on the hanging bulk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) Tet, chet, zayin, vav, he, dalet, gimel, bet, alef...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Fine, don't talk to me &mdash; keep hitting, that solves everything</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Stopping to catch his breath) Maybe we should just crack open a couple of six-packs instead, eh Phelps?</p>

<div class="stage">Craig turns away but not before Zach catches a glimpse of his guilty expression.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Resuming his verbal and non-verbal punches) Did they demote you to Coast Guard shrink or is it bartender now?</p>

<div class="stage">Craig suddenly hurls the bag into Zach, knocking him off balance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You need to be faster on your feet... arm strength isn't enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Conciliatory) Gotcha</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Just trying to help</p>

<div class="stage">Craig decides to show Zach some footwork and leg tricks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Thanks, I appreciate it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Since you've become a total gym rat now, for whatever reason, might as well learn how to go after an enemy properly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> How do you know what I'm doing here, Craig? &mdash; maybe it's simply to look hot for the ladies, did you ever think of that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You never had trouble in that department before, Zachary - besides, I know seething when I see it - you forget how long I've worked with Anita...</p>

<div class="stage">There is an uncomfortable silence as Craig goes back to holding the bag.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Smacking it again) Do you really want to know what's happened to me, what's going on with me? &mdash; it's the same thing that has half this town in the Twilight Zone, the same thing that has you hitting the bottle again, the same thing that has Lieutenant Fury no longer a lieutenant - we're all getting in position!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Position for what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Don't play stupid, Crunch, you're all brawn but I know there's a very sharp brain up there when it's not soaked in bourbon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'm done with this, Isaacson &mdash; get someone else to hold your baggage!</p>

<div class="stage">As Craig starts to walk away, Zach grabs his arm and whips him around. He holds out his right wrist and points to a small spot below the base of his thumb.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> See this? SEE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Pushing Zach away) What is it, a bruise?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No, it's a tattoo of a slingshot</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I don't understand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Voice braking) I got it to remind myself... every time I hold my fist up, I REMIND myself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Of what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Of what David used to bring down Goliath &mdash; but instead of a rock, I'll use a keyboard</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I thought marking yourself was against your religion?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> This expression is beyond my religion, I'm beyond my religion...</p>

<div class="stage">Zach lowers his head and heads for the door. He abruptly pivots and looks Craig dead in the eye.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> And if the keyboard doesn't work, these will!</p>

<div class="stage">He holds up both fists. One dissolves into a friendly wave as the other bashes the door open. Craig shakes his head and quietly contemplates a row of weights before him.</div>

<bar></bar>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Isuzu, Mazda, Suzuki, Kawasaki &mdash; wait, that's a motorcycle &mdash; SHIT... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...</p>

<div class="stage">Now in his car, Zach pulls into the parking lot of the Jade Gate cocktail lounge. He takes a space in the very back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Gracie has eight fingers &mdash; AAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH</p>

<div class="stage">A postcard with palm trees in shadows framing a brilliant orange sunset over purple waters sits in the seat next to him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) All Apologies, Dumb, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle, Heart-Shaped Box, Milk It, Pennyroyal Tea, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, Rape Me...</p>

<div class="stage">Zach slumps down in his seat and begins to sob like a baby. He flashes back to the caves of the Kiyomis. A group of a half dozen hoods surround him as he is tied up and brought before a larger hood in a blue robe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Screaming) MORRIGAN, MORRIGAN &mdash; I HEARD YOU, MORRIGAN &mdash; WHERE ARE YOU?</p>

<div class="stage">The blue robe towers above him. A swift kick in the stomach causes Zach to choke on his tongue.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue robe</span> You never know when to quit, do you Eyes?</p>

<div class="stage">A brown robe punches Zach in the face three times.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Spitting blood) Who... are you?</p>

<div class="stage">The blue robe paces around him but the hood is drawn too forward for Zach to make out a face. The voice is somewhat familiar but the ringing in his ears prevents an identification.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Let Morrigan go!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue robe</span> You don't need to worry about her, she's already dead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> BASTARDS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue robe</span> It's too bad you won't be... I begged them to let me kill you instead of what's about to happen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> YOU DON'T SCARE ME, BEDSHEET</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue robe</span> I should</p>

<div class="stage">He signals to the others and they tear off Zach's remaining clothes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue robe</span> See, the boss thinks you'd be a better example than a corpse</p>

<div class="stage">They push him belly down on the ground and pin each of his limbs to the sides.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue robe</span> (Kneeling lower to Zach's face) It's nothing personal, Zach - in fact, I've always respected you... but we each have a purpose to fulfill</p>

<div class="stage">Two of the brown robes untie their sashes and take their positions.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue robe</span> (Stepping away) BREAK HIM</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> NOOOOOOOOO</p>

<div class="stage">Back in the Jade Gate parking lot, Zach lets out a primal scream. He pounds his fists on the steering wheel and dash. One of the bar patrons taps on the driver's side window.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Patron</span> Buddy, hey buddy, you okay?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach wallops the patron with his car door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Patron</span> (Faltering) WHAT THE HELL?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> GET AWAY FROM ME, ASSHOLE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Patron</span> JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU WERE ALRIGHT &mdash; GET SOME HELP, MAN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> FUCK OFF AND DIE</p>

<div class="stage">The patron gets on his motorcycle and screeches off as Zach strides into the bar. Without saying a word, he motions to the bartender for the tequila bottle and plunks down a c-note. The bartender obliges with the bottle and a shot glass. Zach settles into a corner table and pours himself three drinks in quick succession.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) Arette, Caballo Negro, Cuervo, Galardon, La Corfradia, Sauza...</p>

<div class="stage">A burly older man with a salt and pepper moustache and thinning hair enters the bar and spots Zach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> Starting without me, Eyes?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey, Marv &mdash; thanks for meeting me</p>

<div class="stage">Marv struggles with his jacket for a second, drapes it on the wooden chair and flops down on it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> (Letting out a big sigh) Anything for my favorite paper boy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Ex-paper boy...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> You never did tell me why you quit?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'm freelancing now</p>

<div class="stage">Marv beckons to the server for a beer as Zach pours himself another shot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> It must be keepin' ya pretty busy &mdash; the guys sure do miss your ugly mug at the pool hall</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> They just miss taking my money</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> (Pointing to Zach's arms) Well, you've got some guns grownin' there &mdash; we sure could use those at the firehouse - I'll hook it up if ya ever get tired of the freelancin'</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Thanks, Marv, but I have important business I need to finish...</p>

<div class="stage">There is cool silence as Zach snaps back the shot. Marv quizzically scans around the bar. He quickly turns away as two men in another corner kiss.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> (Lowering his voice) Geez, this ain't your usual haunt, Eyes &mdash; are ya switchin' teams on us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> NEVER... I have to meet another source here later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> Is it about, ya know, my information?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Not directly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> Good, &lsquo;cause the quicker I dump this in your lap, the quicker I can get away from it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hand &lsquo;em over</p>

<div class="stage">Marv skulks around and fishes an overstuffed envelope out of his jacket pocket. He passes it to Zach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> I've seen a lot of weird shit on the job before but in all my years I ain't ever seen nothin' like this!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Flipping through the envelope's contents) And you probably never will again</p>

<div class="stage">Several color pictures of the inside of Bay Valley Medical Center's charred wing peek out above the envelope.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> (Draining his beer) That was not a good scene - me and Rob, the one who took those, are still havin' nightmares...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Searching the photos) I understand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> None of the boys could believe what they were seein' &mdash; we had a hell of a time knockin' the fire down but then... dealin' with those bodies</p>

<div class="stage">Zach catches his breath at a picture of Jason Clark. His body is badly burnt in places but his face is still recognizable and he is covered in the remnants of his blue robe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> (Letting out a slow sigh) Do you know these hooded freaks, Zach?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Voice dropping an octave) Intimately</p>

<div class="stage">Marv waits for a detailed response but it never comes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Can't talk about it now, Marv</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> Big surprise &mdash; ya know, the second we got back to the firehouse from that call, a squad of G-men were there waiting for us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'm guessing they told you to forget what you saw?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> Not only forget what we saw but pretend the whole thing never happened at all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Wiping his nose) Heh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> They tried to tell us that it was a &lsquo;terrorist event' and they didn't want the country going into a massive panic &mdash; ya know, the stock market takin' a dive and all that...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> Rob took the photos with his cell phone, he was the only one who had the smarts to do that</p>

<div class="stage">Zach now hands over an envelope packed with cash.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Please tell him thank you for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> Hey, he wanted to destroy the pics but I took them instead &mdash; I knew that this was important and that I could trust ya with them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'm forever in your debt, Marv</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> All I ask is that ya give me a few months &mdash; the retirement will kick in and then me and Dolores are headed up to Idaho</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No problem, this is going to take some time to crack, but I will do so, I guarantee you that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> You're a good guy, Zach, I don't want anything bad happenin' to ya</p>

<div class="stage">Zach's hand trembles at the urge to crumple Jason's picture.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> It already has...</p>

<div class="stage">Marv goes to say something but directs his focus to the empty beer glass instead.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Extending his hand) Thank you again, Marv</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Marv</span> (Shaking it) Take care of yourself, Eyes</p>

<div class="stage">Marv abruptly gets up, grabs his jacket, and makes a hasty exit as Zach downs another shot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) Azure, beryl, cerulean, cobalt, indigo, navy, periwinkle, royal, sapphire, teal, turquoise, ultramarine...</p>

<div class="stage">Zach flashes back to the day after the explosion. He saunters into his editor's office, unshaven and in shorts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I know I'm a popular man, Jessica, but there's no need to leave 20 messages...</p>

<div class="stage">He suddenly realizes Bill the managing editor and a security guard are also in the office.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What's... going on, Jess?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> (Unable to look him in the eye) Have a seat, Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Eying the security guard) I'd rather stand, thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Bill</span> This is hard for us, Isaacson, you were one of our best and brightest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> &lsquo;Were' - past tense?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> Look, I don't want to do this but you haven't given us much choice...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Um, what &lsquo;choice'? &mdash; you pay me and I turn in excellent work, that's how it's been since I started here!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> That's just it &mdash; you haven't been turning in anything lately</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Okay, so I've been a little out of it...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Bill</span> You've been MIA since the Mt. Wiggins eruption</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> True enough but I would hope that my prior performance in this position would allow you to cut me some fucking slack</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> Zach...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Bill</span> Party a little too much, skip a few days, no problem &mdash; but we need a reporter here when events happen and there have been A LOT of events happening these days</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> One of the biggest was yesterday with the hospital explosion and we couldn't reach you &mdash; we had to give the story to Porter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Spitting with disgust) Porter - have fun with that!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Bill</span> We've been giving too many of your assignments to Porter and others &mdash; now, it will be official</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Getting in Jessica's face) I can understand this guy being an ungrateful asshole, but you, Jess?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> (Pleading) Then give us something, ANYTHING &mdash; if you're doing drugs, we'll understand, or if you have some other health issue going on, be honest about it &mdash; we can put you on leave, get you into treatment...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I don't need treatment, I need a job</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Bill</span> Your avoidance is not helping</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> (Arms folded) We need someone to cover the new PCOC drilling operation in the Kiyomis &mdash; you need to go over there tonight...</p>

<div class="stage">Zach winces and holds his face in his hands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> This is your last chance, Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Sorry, I can't do it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Bill</span> That's it &mdash; give the guard your security clearance, you have 15 minutes to clean out your desk &mdash; Jessica will retrieve any personal files on the company computer for you... goodbye, Isaacson</p>

<div class="stage">The managing editor slams the door behind him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jessica</span> I'm sorry, Zach, you gave me no other choice...</p>

<div class="stage">Zach now returns his thoughts to the present.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (In his head) a, b, c, a and c, b and c, a and b, NONE OF THE ABOVE, NONE OF THE ABOVE, NONE OF THE ABOVE...</p>

<div class="stage">He pours himself another shot as Tim Hajanian enters the bar. Looking pale and in need of a month's worth of sleep, Tim takes a seat near Zach. The two men kissing earlier rush over and wrap Tim in numerous comforting hugs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man #1</span> Timmy, how are you holding up?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man #2</span> We are so sorry, we know how much you loved him</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y4c02_tim_sad.jpg" alt="" height="473" width="620" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Thanks... but I'm just not ready to deal with this here, I hope you understand?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man #1</span> (Patting his arm) Of course we do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man #2</span> When you need us, you know where to find us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">As the two men leave, Tim orders a glass of wine and takes out his cell phone and dials.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Low but still audible to Zach) Jesus Christ, not the voicemail again... Erika, Erika where are you? &mdash; please answer me &mdash; this is Tim, I KNOW it was you at the cabin and I KNOW you have my bag &mdash; why are you doing this? &mdash; I need my bag &mdash; contact me as soon as you GET this!</p>

<div class="stage">Tim slams the phone shut and nearly knocks over his wine glass.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hajanian...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Startled) Oh, Zach, I didn't see you there... hello</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hello</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> You wouldn't happen to know where Erika is, would you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Can't help you there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> It seems no one has seen her since her father's memorial service</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'm sure she's off dealing with her grief... as I'm sure you are &mdash; mind if I join you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Somewhat surprised) Please</p>

<div class="stage">Zach brings his nearly-empty bottle of tequila with him</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> So, what are you doing... here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I have business here... and it's a good place to relax</p>

<div class="stage">Tim is startled to find Zach's hand on his thigh.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Things have been so stressed lately... for both of us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I... I don't understand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Whispering in Tim's ear) Meet me in the alley and you'll understand...</p>

<div class="stage">Tim gasps as he feels the tip of Zach's tongue on his earlobe. Zach stumbles out of his chair and exits out the side door. Tim remains paralyzed in his chair. After a few minutes of mental debate, he cautiously follows Zach out into the alley. The evening shadows overwhelm the tiny area, interrupted by a flickering hazy green glow from the Jade Gate neon sign.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Softly) Zach... where are you?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach comes up behind Tim and wraps his arm around his waist.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Right here</p>

<div class="stage">Tim turns to face Zach but a sharp blow to his side sends him to his knees. Tim chokes on his breath as a sharp kick to the stomach launches a stream of regurgitated wine onto the asphalt.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> What... are... you doing?</p>
