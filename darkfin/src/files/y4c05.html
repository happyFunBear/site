  <h1>Year 4, Chapter 5</h1><h2>&quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;</h2>

 <div class="stage">Two business quarters after the Bay Valley Medical Center explosion...</div>
 
<div class="stage">On the 18th floor of a downtown Vancouver office building, KJ von Meer stares out of a large panoramic window. He outlines the harbor with his finger while snacking on a strawberry muffin.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Receptionist</span> (In French) Mr. Patterson... the doctor will see you now</p>

 <p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y4c04_kj.jpg" alt="" height="510" width="756" border="0"></p>
 
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Wolfing down the remaining half) Merci</p>
 
<div class="stage">Almost 80 lbs. heavier, KJ wipes his hand on his pants and lumbers into the office of Canada's premier psychologist. The room is devoid of any vibrant colors except red pillows on the gray sofa.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Hello, Jack - in town on business again?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Collapsing into an oversized chair) Yep</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> It's good to see you</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Yep</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> I hope you say more than that or this is going to be a very brief session</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Yep</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Okay then, shall we continue where we left off?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Yep</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor raises an eyebrow.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Sure, why not?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Your mother...</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> That bitch</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Well, at least that's a start</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I hate her</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Yes, we've already established that</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> She's never there for me anymore &mdash; she couldn't even be there on my... - do you know where she is today?</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor answers with a stolid gaze.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> WHERE SHE IS EVERY DAY OF HER MISERABLE LIFE &mdash; PLAYING TENNIS &mdash; GOD DAMN TENNIS...</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> You said she used to be a professional?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> DECADES AGO</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Maybe this is what she feels comfortable with right now</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Shouldn't she feel &quot;comfortable&quot; with her own children?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Tell me, why does it make you so uncomfortable?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> BECAUSE OUR WHOLE FAMILY, OUR WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN, INSIDE OUT, AND SHE'S STILL PLAYING WITH A STUPID BALL</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Are you jealous of the ball, Jack?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Sniffing and clearing his throat) YES, okay, yes &mdash; my sister used to constantly complain about it but I always took mom's side &mdash; NOT ANYMORE</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor scratches his nose.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Maybe... JUST MAYBE, if she took one ounce of the effort it takes to swing a racket and placed it into, oh I dunno, MOURNING MY FATHER &mdash; GIVING A DAMN ABOUT MY INCREASINGLY DISTANT SISTER &mdash; OR HELPING ME WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS... maybe my life would be less stressful!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Is that your mother's job &mdash; to make your life less stressful?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> She sure as hell could help</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Did you ever consider that your mom is using tennis to escape the stress?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I'm sure she is but it's time to be an adult and live up to your responsibilities</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Are you talking about yourself now?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Shifting in his seat) Someone has to be the grown-up in the von Meer house &mdash; now that dad is gone, it sure ain't my mom or Erika</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> It is possible that your mother is mourning your father but she has to channel that into serving an ace &mdash; maybe she can't reach your sister because you yourself said she is distant, so your mother hits a lob... is this making sense?</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ offers a reluctant shrug.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> And as for helping you with the business, a backhand down the line is the best she can do</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Stop helping her with excuses, you're supposed to be helping me!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> I am helping you, Jack &mdash; I'm trying to help you realize that you cannot always expect those around you to behave the way you want them to or to give more than they possibly can &mdash; you help yourself by realizing others' limitations and to count on yourself, first and foremost</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I don't need a pep talk, doc</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> You need a talk, you need to talk, you are participating in a discourse with me that is designed to enlighten you about the dark and unsettling areas of your life &mdash; that is why you are here, Mr. Patterson</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Actually, I came for those delicious strawberry muffins in the waiting room &mdash; mind if I go grab another?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> You can... but instead of concentrating on food, why don't you concentrate on the feelings you are experiencing right now?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I'm experiencing hunger</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Are you? &mdash; maybe it's a different kind of hunger &mdash; maybe what you are feeling right now is so disturbing that you would rather deal with the muffin the same way your mother deals with the tennis ball</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ bursts out into nervous laughter and shifts in his seat again.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Shall we continue or do you want to go get a muffin?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Nevermind, I've lost my appetite</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Why don't we shift the focus to your father?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Mumbling) I suppose we could</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> How is his death having an impact on you?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I still can't believe he's gone &mdash; it's been months but it continues to feel so unreal to me</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Explain</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I guess because it happened so suddenly &mdash; I know after the age of 50, it's not as surprising for people to die - but he was in fine health... and it wasn't like we couldn't afford the best doctors in the world</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ and the doctor share a knowing nod and smirk.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> The feeling of guilt is what's really eating me and probably why I'm eating every baked good I can get my hands on... he tried so hard to get me more involved in our business but I didn't care, I always assumed my sister would be the one to step up</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> And she hasn't?</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ unleashes a sarcastic chuckle.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Now she is starting to poke her unwanted nose around but only because the company is soaring</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Do you not feel a sense of achievement because of this?</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ springs up from his seat and paces a bit.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I should... shouldn't I? &mdash; I mean, I have done more than my share, it's not all Riff's doing although I'm sure he thinks so</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Riff is your business partner?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Who is Riff, really?</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor looks at him quizzically.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> We grew up together like brothers and, yes, he is my business partner &mdash; but now, watching him work these last several months, I honestly couldn't tell you who he is &mdash; I can't even tell you who I am</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Do you admire this man? &mdash; do you resent him?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Yes to both &mdash; he's had to deal with a lot of corporate crap living under the shadow of his prick father &mdash; as a kid, he always used to say that he wished my dad was his...</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ inhales deeply and sits back down.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Everyone thought my dad was the greatest...</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> You don't agree?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No, I do - that's the problem</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Do you feel like you can't live up to that?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I don't even wanna try &mdash; but now, I'm forced to</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Is Riff forcing you to live up to your father?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No... he has always wanted me to be my own man, take more control of a situation, handle things better &mdash; exactly the way Riff does</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Have you recast him in the role of your father?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> GOD, I hope not!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Do you feel like you have to compete with him?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> That's the thing, I don't want to compete with ANYONE, I only wanted to do my own thing and help people out where I could</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> A noble goal &mdash; why have you stopped pursuing it?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Rubbing his face with his hands) Because I was forced to</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> By whom?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> More like by &quot;what&quot;</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor waits for an explanation but does not get one.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I'm done talking about Riff</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Alright, instead of talking about individual people, let's talk about another subject altogether &mdash; how would you best describe your former love life and how do you reconcile these feelings in your personal relationships today?</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ laughs out loud and heads for the door.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Sorry, dude, I have GOT to get another one of those muffins before we even start down this road!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Help yourself</p>
 
<div class="stage">As soon as KJ closes the door behind him, the doctor punches a button on his phone pad.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> (In French) Are you getting all of this?</p>
 
<div class="stage">An amused, deep female voice answers in the affirmative. Moments later, KJ returns to his seat in full chew.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Now, do you want to go from past to present or backtrack?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Licking his fingers) I can actually condense this pretty quickly for you... it was party time all the time for me, Riff, and Rikka when we were young &mdash; it's one of the perks of being mega rich</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor makes a note in his folder.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I absolutely enjoyed every minute of meaningless pussy with a bunch of easy, smoking-hot bimbos for well over a decade &mdash; honestly, if you showed me pictures of these girls, I couldn't pick them out if my life depended upon it...</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> A cavalier but not a highly uncommon approach</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I was never mean or abusive but... sure, I used them for fun and physical release, nothing more</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> And now?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I can't even stomach, literally, getting emotionally or physically involved with anyone which is highly ironic considering the situation I'm in</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor makes a few more notes.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> The one-night stand parade hit a brick wall when I met two women who rocked my world</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Am I to assume one of them is your...</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Curtly cutting him off) No</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Are these women still a part of your world?</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ bites his lip hard to keep from crying.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No... Oni is dead</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> What happened?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> She was needed for other purposes</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> That's vague</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> For good reason</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ rubs his face again and pushes the errant blond strands away from his eyes.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Ona Rosa was the love of my life &mdash; my dad thought it was because she represented something I couldn't have since she was already married with kids</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Was he right?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> She was so far beyond that to me &mdash; it wasn't just her beauty and her amazing legal skills either, she was just... herself</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Did she return your feelings?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Not at first &mdash; she fought them and I tried to respect the fact that she had a family</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Did you ever consummate the relationship?</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ hurls one of the red pillows across the room and it slams against the wall.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Sorry &mdash; we were so close but then... then... no, we did not</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> And what about the other woman?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Deep sigh) Morri &mdash; well, let's just say things are very different now</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Can you tell me about her?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I wasn't in love with her like Oni but I did love her &mdash; I think she represented &quot;safe&quot; for me... the funny thing is that she is actually anything but safe</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Are you going to be vague again?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Let's just say she was on the run for something she didn't do &mdash; the &quot;people&quot; that set her up thought she was taken care of until she showed up at the hospital the day it exploded</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Was she directly involved with what happened?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Heh, we were ALL directly or indirectly involved with what happened</p>
 
<div class="stage">The doctor waits but KJ offers no more.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> So Morri is back, the trumped-up charges have magically disappeared and I do mean magically - she now works with me at the PCOC and has an increasingly bizarre relationship with my sister</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Are we revisiting Rikka again?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Seems that way, doesn't it?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> How is Morri involved with Rikka?</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ shakes his head, shrugs, and chuckles.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I suddenly don't feel like talking to you anymore, I'm done for the day</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Remember, Jack, you were the one who sought me out to help you</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Cracking his knuckles) I know &mdash; I also know my ring doesn't fit on my finger, my blood pressure has shot up 60 points, the nightmares I had as a child are back full-force... yet, I don't dare drink or pop pills because I need to keep my mind extra sharp for this game!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> And what game is that?</p>
 
<div class="stage">Before KJ can answer, the doctor's phone buzzes.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Receptionist</span> (Over speaker) Mr. Patterson's wife is here, doctor</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Doctor</span> Thank you</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ leaps to his feet and lets out a deep sigh.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I know it doesn't seem like it but you do help a lot, doc... thanks</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ turns and opens the door to the waiting room. Victoria Martel, picking at her strawberry muffin, rushes over to give KJ a huge hug.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Ready, Honey?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Smiling) I guess so</p>
<bar></bar>
 
<div class="stage">Inhaling a cigar and swirling the liquor in his glass, Griffin is seated a private baccarat table inside a high-end Las Vegas casino. The gentlemen surrounding him for this whale game represent the global elite from the worlds of business and politics.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Caller</span> Card for the banker...</p>
 
<div class="stage">As the game unfolds, a man from the top Singapore shipping conglomerate engages Griffin directly in conversation.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> Judging by how much money you are losing on this game today... and yesterday...</p>
 
<div class="stage">Griffin rips a piece of his card and scowls at the man.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> You must have complete confidence in your company's current prospects?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Complete and utter confidence &mdash; my business partner is in Vancouver as we speak</p>
 <p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y4c04_griff.jpg" alt="" height="579" width="741" border="0"></p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> Wonderful, Mr. Martel, because the port negotiations are going to be a major hurdle for you</p>
 
<div class="stage">The other gentlemen gathered around the table now focus solely on the serious conversation.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> And what is a major hurdle for you will be a losing venture for us</p>
 
<div class="stage">Griffin downs the rest of his drink and rips another card.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Caller</span> (To Griffin) You need to pull a card out of the shoe, sir...</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Now ignoring the game) I do not anticipate any problem whatsoever with the negotiations</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> We all saw what happened when your country's media and citizens got wind of the Dubai deal</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> If anyone knows how to fly under the radar, it's the people I work with &mdash; besides, this is not an election year and everyone has gone back to teeth bleaching and worrying about the next winner of a TV talent show</p>
 
<div class="stage">Some gentlemen at the table chuckle while the businessman continues to frown.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> Your assessment is not based on facts, Mr. Martel &mdash; I will need more convincing than supposition about human behavioral patterns...</p>
 
<div class="stage">A few of the gentlemen at the table nod their heads in agreement with the businessman. Griffin tears the last piece of his card, sighs, and slowly stands up.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You are absolutely right &mdash; you do deserve more convincing than that...</p>
 
<div class="stage">With a nod of Griffin's head, a blue-robed hood appears from the corner of the room and floats to Griffin's side.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> Is this one of your negotiators?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> One of many</p>
 
<div class="stage">Concerned whispers amongst the other gentlemen suddenly fall silent as the businessman begins to lose his breath. Griffin and the blue robe remain exactly where they are.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Businessman</span> (Gagging) WHAT ARE... YOU DOING... STOP... STOP</p>
 
<div class="stage">The businessman's temporal arteries pop and splatter blood all over the table and other gentlemen. His face collapses into his chips.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Anyone else in need of convincing?</p>
 
<div class="stage">Some of the gentlemen flee the table as others stare in shock.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> We are nearly done mining and processing the metal, it will be ready to ship in weeks &mdash; there will be no, let me repeat, NO negotiation problems &mdash; you, your businesses, and your countries will either reap the rewards with us... or you will be in our way</p>
 
<div class="stage">The blue hood now leaves the room as the remaining gentlemen bow to Griffin's will.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Now, if you will excuse me, I have a suite filled with beautiful young women covered in sushi and white lines who are in dire need of my attention, thank you</p>
