  <h1>Year 1, Chapter 6</h1><h2>Human Behavior</h2>

<div class="stage">On the 57th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper, KCON reporter Kylee Shepperton is representing the station at a meeting with network executives. On top of a polished, cheery wood table, she is naked and on all fours as three middle-aged men in various stages of undress from their tailored suits take turns performing sexual acts on her. The persistent, musical ringing of her cell phone interrupts them.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y1c6_tabletop.jpg" width="570" height="404" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Wiping her face) Excuse me for a moment, gentlemen</p>

<div class="stage">She crawls over the end of the table where her purse is and takes out the bright pink phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Yes? - Dammit, Turner, now is NOT a good time - look, I'm right in the middle of something... literally - no, I do not know what's happening in Duquesa Bay, I'm on the other side of the fucking country, and unless it's a 7.0 with the epicenter in downtown Santa Conchita, I could care less... wait a minute, wait a minute, calm down - what is going on? - HOLD ON</p>

<div class="stage">The woman glares up at the man directly in front of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Mr. Anderson, I can't really do that and talk on the phone at the same time, you're going to have to entertain yourself for a moment... so, Turner, you're telling me we have bodies washing up on shore, a train wreck, and oil seeping into the river in one day? - when did Satan let all Hell break loose? - what about that new reporter, I thought you were getting her to cover for me - SHE WHAT? - OH MY GOD - well, isn't that just PERFECT... give me a little longer to come to terms with the network boys, once we close the deal, I'll be on the next flight... OK, bye!</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee sighs, puts the phone away and crawls back to her original position.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Now, where were we?</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Back in Santa Conchita, the blast from the exploding train and oil nearly knocks the USCG helicopter out of the sky.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Fighting for control) SON OF A...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> YOU GOT IT, ANITA, HOLD ON, KEEP IT STEADY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Leveling off) WHERE IN THE HELL THAT COME FROM?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Into his radio) WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO LIGHT IT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> DEAR GOD, MCBRIDE WAS HEADING BACK FOR THE TRAIN WHEN IT WENT UP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> FORGET HER, SHE'S NOTHING MORE THAN A CINDER, WE'VE GOT TO CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THIS THING UNDER CONTROL - NOW, WHO GAVE THE GOD DAMN ORDER TO LIGHT THIS?</p>

<p><img border="0" height="285" width="384" src="../assets/images/slick_fire.jpg" alt="The River of Fire!" align="right"></p>


<div class="stage">A voice squawks through the speakers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Voice</span> No one gave any orders to begin the burn, Captain - it just kinda happened on its own</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> BULLSHIT, IT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN ON ITS OWN, SOMEONE SPARKED IT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I have a bad feeling I know EXACTLY who did</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> So HELP me, if your nature-freak brother-in-law or any of his lab buddies are involved in this...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Clenching her teeth in anger) ALETA OSCURA</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I think the fumes have GONE TO YOUR HEAD, LIEUTENANT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> At least I don't have my head up my ASS... sir</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I said it in plain English, not Espa&ntilde;ol</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> We'll take this up again later, Fiore - right now, we need to track where the new smoke is headed, wind speed, AS WELL AS, come up with a way to protect our necks once the higher ups come looking for a scapegoat - and if you say LAYTO OSKERBA again, I will THROW you out of this chopper!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Craig, save yourself the embarrassment and just call her &quot;Darkfin&quot; from now on</p>

<div class="stage">Amongst the confusion on the ground, Zach stands in bewilderment, looking at where part of the bridge once was as rescue workers try to suppress the fire and tend to the injured man from the train. Gracie rushes over to him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Where is she, Eyes, where's Morrigan?</p>

<div class="stage">Zach does not respond.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Shaking him) I SAID, WHERE IS SHE? - ZACH, ANSWER ME, WHERE IS SHE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Voice wavering) I think she's dead, Gracie - I... I told her not to go back - some guy... she went... I don't... I told her...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Crying) SHIT, SHIT SHIT SHIT, I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. Javier &quot;Sandy&quot; Sanchez and Dr. Shelby Willis from Santa Conchita University's biology department arrive on the scene to help coordinate the cleanup efforts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Checking her pager) Where in the world is Erika? - I thought for sure she'd be the first one here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> She's probably stuck in traffic, the 101 is completely shut down and Riverbank is a total mess</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I heard from one of the firemen that some reporter got caught in the explosion</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Yet another tragedy, I'll be glad when this day is finally finished</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Looking out over the water) I hate to say it but this fire is a godsend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Pulling a bag of cashews out of his pocket and snacking on them) Yep, this was shaping up to be one colossal nightmare</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Those government buffoons cannot be counted on to do anything right!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking up at Anita's helicopter) You know as well as I do how protocol bound they are, gotta get a triplicate order to use the toilet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Would you be defending them if your sister-in-law weren't one of them, Dr. Sanchez?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Excellent observation, Dr. Willis!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Hmm</p>

<div class="stage">Shelby takes some of Sandy's nuts, lays them reverently on the river's edge, chants and does a small but energetic dance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking embarrassed) Is now really the right time for you to be doing your Santeria?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> It's &quot;Ocha&quot; to me and it is indeed the right time, I am giving thanks to Olorun for preventing the death of this great river</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Rolling his eyes) Ah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> You have your beliefs, I have mine!</p>

<div class="stage">Heather Raleigh, a cute, young woman with glasses and freckles bounces over to the two of them with some jars and plastic bags in her hands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Heather</span> Hey Sandy, I'm done collecting my samples, the others should be done soon too</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Squeezing her shoulder) Thank you, Heather, you and the other students are an immense help!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Heather</span> (Giggling) Hi, Dr. Willis, I loved your lecture in class yesterday</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Really? - and what part in particular did you find most fascinating?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Heather</span> Um... all of it was very cool!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Sideways glance at Dr. Sanchez) Mm-hmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Heather</span> (Smiling coyly at Dr. Sanchez) Well, I think I'll take these back to the lab and get started on them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> I'll come by later to get your analysis</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Heather</span> (Leaving) Great... bye, Dr. Willis!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> MM-HMM</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> What is that tone in your voice?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I'll be glad to take a look at Ms. Raleigh's... DATA... for you - after we're through here... go home to Ona Rosa and the children!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Mm-Hmm</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Further up the river, away from the lights and commotion, Darkfin surfaces with Morrigan in her arms and heads for the shore with Pete the Border Collie dog paddling behind them. She gently settles the reporter on the sand and takes her pulse.</div>


<p><a href="../assets/images/y1c6_rescue.jpg"><img src="../assets/images/y1c6_rescue.jpg" width="620" height="496" border="0"></a></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (To the dog) Look after her</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin holds out her left hand, crooks her index finger once and summons her trident. It flies out of a still burning patch of water and returns to her grasp. With that, she quickly dives into the murky depths and disappears as Pete begins licking Morrigan's face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Drifting in an out of consciousness) Quit it, Mike... I don't feel like it right now</p>

<div class="stage">The dog starts to bark and jump around her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Fully opening her eyes) What... what happened?</p>

<div class="stage">The big brown KCON newsvan is taking a beating as Gracie kicks the sides.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> THAT NO GOOD FOR NOTHING WHORE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> That's not fair, Grace, we didn't have enough time to really know McBride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MORRI, I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT SLUT, SHEPPERTON - SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE COVERING THE STORY, NOT BLOWING THE SUITS IN NEW YORK - KYLEE SHOULD BE THE DEAD ONE RIGHT NOW - DAMN THAT BITCH TO HELL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Call the station and send another team to cover for you, we both need to get out of here and clear our heads</p>

<div class="stage">The two start to leave when Pete runs over to them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Noticing the wet, oil-covered dog) Hey Boy, where did you come from? - come here, we'll get you some help... it's OK, c'mon</p>

<p><img border="0" height="191" width="208" src="../assets/images/pete_the_dog.gif" alt="Pete the Dog" align="right"></p>


<div class="stage">The dog prances around, barking, and encourages the two to follow him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Zach, get one of your fireman buddies to take care of the dog, I want to go home!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Chasing after Pete) I just want to see what has him all upset</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Under her breath) Maybe Timmy fell down the well again...</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie sighs and leans her head against the side of the van. Moments later, a stunned, silent Zach rushes up to her, grabs the camerawoman's arm and drags her with him down the slope to the river's edge, where Pete stands next to Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Quickly covering her eyes) OH MY GOD, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER BODY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Turing her head slightly) Gracie, is that you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> AAAAHHHH</p>

<div class="stage">Takanachi goes over to McBride's side and holds her hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> HELP, GO GET HELP, ZACH - DON'T STAND THERE GAWKING, GO</p>

<div class="stage">The still speechless Isaacson takes off with the dog running after him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hey there, Morri, hold on... you're going to be just fine... Zach is going to get help, OK? - HOLD ON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Coughing) I don't think I'm very telegenic right now...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Brushing some mud off of Morri's face) You look great, Sweetie, don't you worry!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do I have to work tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Laughing) I'll see what I can do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Starting to lose consciousness again) Gracie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I... I saw the hand - I saw the hand, Gracie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What hand? - Morri... Morrigan - HURRY UP, ZACH</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Up in the sky, Craig and Anita continue to assess the situation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (On his radio) The fire is under control, but they want us on the ground, PRONTO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> They just want to parade our uniforms in front of the media and make us answer the hard questions</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Rubbing his eyes) As if we haven't done that enough today</p>

<p><img border="0" height="124" width="300" src="../assets/images/chopper_2.gif" alt="Coast Guard Helicopter" align="right"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> What are we going to tell them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Haven't the slightest clue - I'll buy you a steak if you come up with a PLAUSIBLE explanation for the fire</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Sorry, I'm having pasta with the folks and you already KNOW what... or should I say WHO... I think started it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Sighing) You might as well just say god damn space aliens set it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Who knows where this creature came from, it could be...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> DON'T START, DON'T... YOU... START</p>

<div class="stage">Anita mumbles something in Spanish under her breath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> SPEAK ENGLISH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Half-smile) YOU... ARE... A... LIMP... DICK - is that better, Captain?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> At least I have one!</p>

<div class="stage">The two glare at each other for a moment and then break out into wide grins.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Let's head back to base, Lieutenant</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Fine, we need to refuel anyway... wait a minute - WAIT A MINUTE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Trying to see what she's seeing) What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> GIMME THE INFRARED, QUICK</p>

<div class="stage">Grabbing the goggles before the perplexed man even has a chance to hand them over, the excited woman falls silent as she focuses on the object in the river.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Slapping her thigh) LA DIABLAAAAAA HA HA HA - I SEE YOU, I SEEEEEE YOU - I KNEW IT</p>

<p><img border="0" height="251" width="620" src="../assets/images/df_binoculars.jpg" alt="Anita's view through the binoculars"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> WHAT IN THE HELL ARE YOU BLABBERING ABOUT NOW?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Calmly handing over the instrument) Take a look for yourself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Doing so) I see NOTHING but some debris and... uh... uh... oh my...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> TELL ME IT'S A DOLPHIN, TELL ME IT'S A DOLPHIN - GO ON, TELL ME IT'S A FUCKING DOLPHIN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Still looking at the unmistakable silhouette of Darkfin) I... um... heh, we can't say for sure exactly what it is until... OOOMPH</p>

<div class="stage">Lieutenant Fiore sharply banks the helicopter left in a rapid descent, causing Captain Phelps' face to smash up against the glass.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> FIORE - THIS IS NOT AN EPISODE OF AIRWOLF</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Leveling off) Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Rubbing his jaw) Do you know how much these porcelain caps cost?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Still giving chase) THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY, CRAIG</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Our opportunity for what, SUICIDE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Unbuckling herself) We can't get too close to the surface or she'll see us - once we're right on top of her, take over the controls!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Whatever insanity is in your head right now, NO - AND THAT'S AN ORDER</p>

<p><img border="0" height="58" width="235" src="../assets/images/knife.gif" alt="Anita's combat knife" align="right"></p>


<div class="stage">Anita takes off her shoes and watch, puts away her wallet and pulls out a double-edge combat knife.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> DO YOU HEAR ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Taking her helmet off) Not very well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I'VE FLOWN SOLO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Positioning herself) I know you know how to fly this thing, you're checked out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> WE'RE LOW ON FUEL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Focusing on her intended target) You should have enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> SHOULD?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Opening the door) Get ready, Craig</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> This is NOT going to happen!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Time to fillet a fish!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> FIORE, FIORE GET BACK INSIDE</p>

<div class="stage">Looking back at her captain one last time, the woman clenches her knife tightly and dives off the helicopter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> EAAAAH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> ANITAAAA</p>
