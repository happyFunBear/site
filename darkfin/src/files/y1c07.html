<div class="stage">As the Santa Conchita University clock tower chimes midnight, Erika von Meer conceals herself on the beach under a pile of washed up kelp. She gasps for breath as her transformation back from Darkfin remains incomplete</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I... I need... to get...</p>

<div class="stage">Struggling to her feet, she quickly collapses into unconsciousness.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside her hospital room, Morrigan McBride is having flashbacks of the train wreck. Bits and pieces run across her mind as she remembers the force of the explosion knocking her into the river. Under water, she feels someone grabbing a hold of her, rushing towards the surface. Before blacking out, the last thing Morrigan sees is the green hand. The young woman opens her eyes to Gracie and Zach staring back at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> She's awake!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey there, Super Girl!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Wincing) Coffee breath, guys</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Backing away) Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You scared the living shit out of us, Morri</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I did a pretty good job of scaring myself as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> How are you feeling?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> A little woozy - where am I?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> In &quot;The Butcher Shop&quot; - also known as Bay Valley Medical Center</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's nice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Don't worry, you have Stephanie Martel as your doc, she's the only decent one here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Zach is her biggest fan - ever since he broke his arm roller blading, he's had a huge crush on her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Not true!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Oh?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> She's old enough to be my mom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> And when has this stopped you before?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying to sit up) GUYS, this is all very interesting but OW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Sorry, we'll give our full attention back to you now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you - is there anything seriously wrong with me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Besides having no common sense? - just cuts and bruises - they want to keep you overnight for observation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I did what I had to do because it was the right thing to do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You sound like an oatmeal commercial, stop it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Should we prepare her now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Prepare me for what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> The onslaught outside your door - Turner Gates is waiting to meet you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The station manager?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yes, the great Caesar himself wants to pay you a little visit... thank you for being a hero and jacking up overnight numbers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her head) That's all I need</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You have the phones ringing off the hook with concerned viewers - the hallway is stacking up with flowers and stuffed animals</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> It's giving me frightening flashbacks of my sisters' rooms</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Do we need to go there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Thought so - anyway, you're a savvy girl, Morri, you know what a self-serving opportunity this is for KCON - the question is... do you wanna play?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The small headache I had before is now turning into a throbbing monster!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Thrusting his hands in his pocket) Speaking of monsters, I saw Kylee in the hall with Turner - she flew back on account of you, Lady McBride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, my guess is she'll be doing one of her sickeningly sweet &quot;interview the interviewer&quot; type deals, usually reserved for sweeps</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Aren't I blessed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> AND, since Doc Steffi is Gates' sister, he could order her to give you an enema until you talked</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My life keeps getting better with each passing second</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> It's totally up to you, M&amp;M - say you're too sick and tell them all to screw off... then give your exclusive interview to yours truly for the Daily Beacon!</p>

<p><img  b="0" h="337" w="200" src="../assets/images/dream_hand.gif" a="center"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> HA - I'll tell you what, I will give you an exclusive quote for your story if you go and get me some hot chocolate</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Smiling) You're a cheap date - if I put marshmallows in it, will you mention my heroics as well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Depends on how many marshmallows you put in, Mr. Isaacson</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Clapping his hands once and pointing) Sounds like a deal</p>

<div class="stage">As Zach heads out the door, Morrigan beckons Gracie to her side</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You know, Morri, he's right, if you don't feel like doing the interview, don't do it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Serious tone) That's the least of my concerns</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> The doctors checked you out, you're going to be fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Listen to me, Gracie... I saw the hand!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I have no idea what you're talking about</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The hand... THE HAND IN MY DREAM - who or whatever this creature is... rescued me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Morrigan, Honey, you're tired, you've been through a lot tonight...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing the dark-haired woman's shoulders) YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> SHHHHH, I do, I do - OK, what do you want me to do about it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Go back to the van, run through the footage, you might have caught something on tape... please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Pulling back) Alright, I'll see what I can find</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Calmer) Thanks, Gracie... you know I'm not completely nuts, right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Leaving) Yes, I do, now try to get some rest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking at her hospital bed) That shouldn't be too hard</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside a utility closet, next to the Neonatal Intensive Care unit, Kylee Shepperton is welcomed back by her boss, Turner Gates.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> OH, TURNER, IT'S SOOOO HARD, YES, YES BABE, GIVE IT TO ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Increasing his rhythm) How many of them were there this time?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I haven't cum yet but I'm sure it will be DOZENS of times - you are so the master!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Growing angry) How many NETWORK MEN did you do this time, Kylee?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Shifting her position) Why do you ask me that, it only makes you jealous?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Thumping her against the wall) I... AM... NOT... JEALOUS - HOW... MANY? - ANSWER... ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Only four and they weren't that good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Don't be patronizing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> OK, one was hung like a horse and he fucked me until I passed out - happy now?</p>

<div class="stage">The older man nearly slaps the woman across the face but stops and quickly withdraws from her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Cool) Don't you even THINK about hitting me, Mr. Gates, or I will make your life a living nightmare - I'm sure your lovely wife and family would enjoy seeing pictures of your dick hanging out of my mouth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Pulling up his pants) Did you accomplish everything in New York?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Fixing her skirt and hair) They agreed to all of your terms - one of them will be flying in to &quot;seal the deal&quot; this week</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Fine, meet me in front of McBride's room in five minutes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Watching him leave) Fine</p>

<div class="stage">The shapely woman takes out her hot pink cell phone and dials.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Hi, I'm back - I just finished with the Old Goat and I had to deal with four losers this afternoon - I need a REAL man tonight, are you up for me? - great, give me an hour, bye</p>

<div class="stage">As Kylee leaves the room, she walks down the hall and passes Captain Phelps and a drenched Lieutenant Fiore in the emergency room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Well now, if it isn't the Dynamic Duo of Duquesa Bay! - what happened Anita, did your girlfriend try to drown you again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Shivering in a blanket) Shut up, Kylee</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Winking) You know you want me - hello Craig, is there a story here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Not really, Lieutenant Fiore thought she saw a civilian in the water and attempted a rescue... it turned out to be... ahem, a log</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Beaming directly at a scowling Anita) Excuse me, I didn't quite hear that last part?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> A LOG... A FUCKING LOG... NOW, BE A GOOD LITTLE SLUT AND RUN ALONG</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Over-the-top laughter) I didn't realize you were a tree hugger as well - watch out for splinters!</p>

<div class="stage">Anita starts to go after Kylee but is held back by Craig.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Taking off) Goodnight, Captain</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Ms. Shepperton</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Sitting back a little dizzy) That PUTA is going to get hers one day, you mark my words!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Take it easy there - haven't you had enough excitement for one day? - you have a slight concussion</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Rubbing her head) Don't remind me</p>

<hr>

<p><img src="../assets/images/sewer.jpg" h="520" w="520"  b="0"></p>


<div class="stage">Awakening once more, Erika realizes that she still has not completely changed back to human form. Making sure no one is around, she slips into the sewers, heading towards downtown Santa Conchita.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I have... no other choice</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">As Zach walks towards Morrigan's room with the hot chocolate, he suddenly pauses and sniffs the air.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I smell sex and watermelon lipgloss... HELLO, KYLEE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Strutting up behind him) Enjoy the smell, Eyes, because it's as close as you'll ever get</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Thank God</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Liar</p>

<div class="stage">As the two are about to launch into a verbal exchange, Turner comes over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Putting his arm around Kylee) Zachary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Turner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> That was an amazing little piece you did in yesterday's paper</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Glancing at the strawberry blonde) You're doing an amazing little piece yourself, Mr. Gates</p>

<div class="stage">Turner just smiles as Kylee looks offended.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> We're about to go in and interview my new star reporter on her ordeal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Protective) You might want to ask Morrigan if she's up to it, first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Taking the hot chocolate out of Zach's hands) Of course</p>

<div class="stage">The tall man with thinning auburn hair knocks and enters the room simultaneously, as Kylee and Zach follow.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Handing her the drink) Ms. McBride, how are you doing? - I'm Turner Gates, the KCON station manager - you gave us all quite the scare earlier</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Extending her hand) Nice to finally meet you, sir, sorry about that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Hey, don't be - you had viewers glued to their sets - hell of a way to start your first day</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> And we both saved a couple of lives</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Does a dog count?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I think so!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> That's true - good job, both of you - but I hope you don't think you're getting a bonus so soon, Morgan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> MORRIGAN... and I already received my bonus when the man thanked me in the ambulance</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee leans against the wall and rolls her eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> I know, I know - just joking - so, are you up to getting that &quot;thank you&quot; again on tape?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Well, I suppose...</p>

<div class="stage">Before she can finish her sentence, Turner is out the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'll let you two ladies get acquainted, I need to take a leak</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks for the hot chocolate, Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Hurrying out) Sure thing!</p>

<div class="stage">Pulling out an emery board, the statuesque woman saunters over to the smaller woman's bedside, filing a chipped nail.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> So, what do you think of Duquesa Bay?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Um, I'm not sure yet, I've only been here a day and I've basically been in my car, Gracie's apartment, and the hospital... oh, and the river is very pretty</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Still filing) Hmm</p>

<div class="stage">There is a long moment of silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I read your resume - over a half-dozen awards - very impressive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you - I understand you were Miss Alabama</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> AND second runner-up to Miss America</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hmm</p>

<div class="stage">The taller woman stops filing and looks directly at Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Are you interested in the anchor chair?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm totally happy being a field reporter - I'm not one for sitting on my backside, reading off of a teleprompter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> That's nice - and what do you think of Turner?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I think he's my boss, that's it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Half smile) Good answer</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee comes closer to Morrigan's side.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> You have your territory, I have mine - stay off of mine and we'll get along just fine!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hey, you made a rhyme!</p>

<div class="stage">Before Kylee can respond, the room suddenly erupts with commotion as Turner returns with a camera crew, the man Morrigan saved, Pete the dog, Zach, and a visibly upset Gracie.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> (Handing Kylee a mike) Let's get rolling - McBride, try to look a little more distressed</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan gives him an evil glare.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> Perfect!</p>

<div class="stage">After the interview is finished, everyone exits except Gracie and Zach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What's wrong, Fingers?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> They're gone</p>

<p><img  b="0" h="250" w="209" src="../assets/images/gracie_headshot.gif" a="center"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Someone stole my tapes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Are you sure you didn't misplace them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> If you say that one more time, Eyes, I'm going to SMASH you - someone stole my fucking tapes - the segment footage is all there but the b-roll, GONE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Unbelievable</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Suddenly cheering up) BUT, the good news is that I always make back up copies of everything I shoot and whoever took the originals wasn't aware of that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> YES - WAY TO GO, TAKANACHI</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Patting Morrigan's arm) You get some rest, Missy, and I'll be back in the morning with what I find out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Zach makes a funny face at Morrigan as the two leave the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rolling on her side) Finally, maybe I can get some sleep</p>

<div class="stage">Seconds later, a nurse enters the room and goes over to the exhausted woman.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> Ms. McBride, since this is a semiprivate room, we will be wheeling in another patient shortly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excellent</p>

<div class="stage">The nurse draws the partitioning curtain as Lieutenant Fiore enters with Captain Phelps. Morrigan pretends she is sound asleep as Craig helps Anita settle in.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I DON'T need to be here - this is ridiculous</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> It's just a precaution, relax and get some rest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> RELAX? - I don't think I can ever relax again - she's REAL, Craig, Aleta Oscura is REAL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Looking past the curtain to a pseudo sleeping Morrigan) Shh... quiet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Whispering) I had her in my grasp - then she slapped away my knife like it was nothing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Did you land any blows?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Those scales on her are like a suit of armor - it was like I was punching a linoleum-covered floor, plus she was way stronger than me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Did she try to communicate with you at all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> By trying to drown me, I think she was pretty much saying &quot;fuck you, Anita&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> What exactly happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> She grabbed me by the neck and held me under water to where I started blacking out, I thought for sure I was a goner - next thing I know, I am being flung across the river, over 15 yards, and end up crashing onto the shore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Scratching his mustache) She could have killed you... why didn't she?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Good question</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">On a darkened side street next to the hospital, Erika slinks out of a manhole and carefully makes her way inside the building without being noticed. She goes to the basement laundry and finds some surgical scrubs to wear.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Dizzy) I need to rest, first</p>

<div class="stage">Spotting some clean linens, Dr. von Meer wraps herself in a blanket and curls up in the corner.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Why, dammit, why?</p>
