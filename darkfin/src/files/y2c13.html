      <p>Anita is over at Kylee's when they hear about the shooting. Erika takes Griffin's car and zooms off to the church. As Gracie and Jeremy discuss life and music, Zach arrives and tells them the news. Morrigan and Erika get into a car accident with each other. Eventually, everyone gathers at the church where Morrigan instantly recognizes her stolen gun as the murder weapon.</p>

<div class="stage">Outside on Kylee's patio, Anita Fiore installs a new hummingbird feeder as the strawberry blonde finishes her yoga routine.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Oh, and when you're done with that, there's a leak in the bathroom sink that needs fixing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Banging hard on the wood) You called me over here for this, not the sink</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Doing an exaggerated bend) Can't you find time for the sink as well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Nope - I have a date tonight - I need to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Is it not your job to make sure the tenants' needs are satisfied?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Scoffing) IF they call and make a proper appointment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> When would be a good time for you to fix my sink?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Rolling her eyes) I'll take a quick look at it before I leave but I'll probably have to come back and fix it tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Fake smile) That would be fine, thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Climbing down off of the ladder) So, what happened to your old hummingbird feeder?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Nonchalant) The wind knocked it down</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c13_kylee_anita.jpg" h="452" w="520"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Did this &quot;wind&quot; happen to have the name Turner?</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee looks up at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Lady, unless there was a hurricane I neglected to notice, there's no way the damage on that beam could have been done by a simple gust or two - your feeder was ripped out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Quickly getting up) Whatever, it's none of your business</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Following) I'll make it my business if he treated you the same way!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I appreciate the chest thumping, Fiore, but it's not necessary - it was only a little disagreement with a lot of rough sex</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Sex doesn't have to be rough, you know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Smirking) It does if that's how you prefer it - now, please don't forget to check my sink</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Twirling her wrench) Right</p>

<div class="stage">Before Anita reaches the bathroom, her cell phone goes off. She sighs and answers it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Hola... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, ONI CALM DOWN - WHAT HAPPENED?... QUICK, KYLEE, TURN ON THE NEWS</p>

<div class="stage">The woman does so and watches the KCON report about the shooting at Saint Brendan's.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> DAMMIT, WHY WASN'T I CALLED IN FOR THIS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Still on the phone) ARE MOM AND DAD OK? - TELL THEM I'M ON MY WAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> I bet he gave it to that bitch, McBride</p>

<div class="stage">Anita is already out the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> WAIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIX YOUR SINK NOW, SHEPPERTON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Slipping on some shoes and grabbing a purse) WAIT UP, I'M GOING WITH YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Already down the stairs) MOVE THAT PRETTY ASS, THEN</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Erika is running down the office stairs with Griffin trailing close behind. They reach the bottom level.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Huffing and puffing) Would... you please... tell me... where you are going to... in such a hurry?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Pausing) I just remembered an important SCU meeting I had on the other side of town - it slipped my mind completely</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Why can't you call them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Hesitant) I suppose I could... but I forgot the number</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c13_erika_griffin.jpg" h="501" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Erika... what is wrong with you?</p>

<div class="stage">She turns to face him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> If this really is about an SCU meeting, you would never forget something like that - OR an important phone number</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's natural for people to forget from time to time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes... if you're 80 and drooling - my mother thinks you might be taking drugs - are you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, RIF</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You can tell me if you are - I'll get you any help you need - you stood by me during my little coke excursion in college, let me be here for you now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Trying to calm herself) Griffin... really - I appreciate the sentiment, I honestly do - but you, of all people, should know me better than that - I am not a junkie - I just have a lot of things happening right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Flirtatious) Let me help you with those things - certainly there must be something non-scientific that I could do</p>

<div class="stage">Erika struts over to him and searches his pant pockets.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Stunned) HERE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Grabbing his car keys) I'll return it later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You hate to drive - let me come with you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> NO</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin stares at her in silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Look, I need to do this alone... I'll tell you what, you know that trip to Napa you keep begging me to take?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Full smile) You'll go?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes... to discuss Meeramar business</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Of course</p>

<div class="stage">Erika rushes over to Griffin's car, gets in, and zooms off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Watching) We'll see about that</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside her apartment, Gracie is laying down some new techno tracks with Jeremy. She is oblivious to her pager going off with the music thumping and blaring.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y2c13_gracie_jere.jpg" h="358" w="470"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Holding up headphones to one ear) THIS IS A SWEET SOUND - WHERE DID YOU GET IT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Jumping around) WHAT?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie turns down the music a bit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I SAID... this sound is killer - where did you come up with it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Oh, I got it from my Dutch buddies - it's a distorted waterpipe mixed with ice-skating layered on top of a jungle beat</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> EXCELLENT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Hey, I swung by earlier but you weren't home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I was out with the crew watching that new lame sci-fi movie, consuming vast quantities of pizza and beer, and listening to one of McBride's horror stories</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Sounds like a decent evening</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> On paper it was</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Wasn't the movie any good?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Let's just say I enjoyed my pizza and beer and leave it at that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> So Hal didn't go with you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Heh, he took off to Arizona for a few days - God only knows why</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Didn't he tell you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> No, why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Isn't he your boyfriend?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I honestly don't know what Hal is... but he certainly is not my boyfriend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Oh - well, don't worry, Grace - you'll find the right guy eventually!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> PLEASE, young man, don't you dare join the Cinderella chorus of &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;... unless it's remixed with a Marilyn Manson song</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Hmm, I might actually do that for Penny - but, seriously, some dude will see the true inner beauty of one Gracie Takanachi and be completely blown away</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That &quot;inner beauty&quot; crap works well for afternoon talk shows and Hallmark stores but it sure ain't reality now is it? - the bottom line is that I'm a fat, non-white, freak with eight fingers... you try peddling that in the land of Pamela Anderson!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Whoa - is that how you see yourself? - no wonder you attract scum like Hal! - I see a creative, intelligent, funny, super hot older lady...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> UGH - you were doing fine until that part</p>

<div class="stage">The two chuckle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I honestly don't see it as a problem but you do, so some friendly advice, cut back on the double bacon cheeseburgers, as for your fingers or lack of, no one can even see them at first and it's no big deal - finally, for the not being white part... if being white is so beautiful, then explain to me why thousands of women on a daily basis risk skin cancer by baking themselves on the beach or in a tanning salon?</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie can only shrug her shoulders.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> What you project out there is what you're gonna get back</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You sound like my mother</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> She's right - I mean, you obviously aren't going to get the boring accountant in khakis who thinks a drink at El Torito is the highlight of his month - you wouldn't want that anyway</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Look, Little Man, I appreciate the pep talk - you're a damn good friend but things are different for a girl - just ask yours... speaking of Penny, why aren't you with her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I'll catch up with her later - I really wanted you to hear these samples</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> They're awesome, I'm sure I'll be able to use them 
 - OH, I talked to my brother the other day, I sent him some of your 
 sketches - he might be able to use a few designs</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Jumping up and down) WOOHOOOO - YOU ARE SO IT, GRACIE, THANK YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Smiling) You have real talent, Kiddo, it's just a matter of trying to get bank for it in this catatonic society</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, there is a loud banging on the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at her watch) Jesus, do they know the time?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Maybe it's &quot;Mr. Right&quot; doing a late night margarita run</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> GRACIE, IT'S ZACH, OPEN UP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at Jeremy) BULLSEYE... I meant BULLSHIT</p>

<div class="stage">Takanachi throws open the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I thought you'd still be with Justine?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (All serious) Where's your pager?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Going over to her TV) Who has your shift at KCON tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Walls and Rubin, why?</p>

<div class="stage">The scene at the church flashes across the television.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> TWISTED</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's very sad and all but I'm not Catholic and it's my night off</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> THINK, Grace - who was going over to St. B's tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> HOLY FREAKING GOD, MORRIGAN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> LET'S GO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Almost out the door) Jere, lock up for me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> No problem</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Slowly cruising down the back streets away from the church for well over 15 minutes, Morrigan is in a haze, contemplating her meeting with Joenne. With Bryan Ferry's &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; filling the interior of the car, she ignores the ringing cell phone beside her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Out loud) I wonder if I should inform my mermaid about the office temp/tap dancer/CIA operative? - I can't believe this is an actual question I just uttered!</p>

<div class="stage">She reaches over to adjust the volume on her stereo and does not see the black Lexus barreling towards her. The other car brakes quickly and side-swipes her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pulling over) DAMMIT - add another to the list!</p>

<div class="stage">McBride gets out and walks over to the other car. She is shocked to see Erika emerge from it, shaking.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OH MY GOD, Dr. von Meer - I am so, so sorry - it's all my fault - I wasn't paying attention to the road!</p>

<div class="stage">A silent Erika takes Morrigan's hands in hers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You're OK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Perplexed) Yes, I'm fine... really</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Not letting go) Nothing has happened to you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, no - I'm not hurt - I'm a little worried about you, though... you're trembling</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm not a big fan of driving</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And I just helped to reinforce that, sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Finally letting go of her hand) Don't worry about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is that your car?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> No, Griffin Martel's</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> THAT'S JUST GREAT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Don't worry, I'll handle Griffin... and I'll take care of you as well</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c13_erika_morri.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh no, this was clearly my fault</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You are too honest for your own good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> So I've been told - let's call this in and get a report going so we both can be on our way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> NO</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is slightly taken aback by the forcefulness of the statement.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> There is no need to involve the police and the insurance companies - you might have been partially at fault but I was speeding, so I am just as much to blame... I'll take care of Griffin's car and I would really like to pay for some of the damage to yours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Considering this) Hmm, actually, that sounds pretty fair - and I've had more than enough excitement for tonight... fine, thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What kind of excitement?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Huh? - oh, just a fun-filled date with your brother and four others</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Well then, good night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Wait!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan goes to touch a cut above Erika's eye, causing the taller woman to recoil.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You're bleeding and a lens in your glasses is cracked, I think you should see a doctor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Just now realizing it) I'll be alright</p>

<div class="stage">Erika starts to walk away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Catching up to her) NOPE - you are not driving like that - c'mon, I'll take you to where you need to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's not necessary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, it is - I'm not taking the chance of you having another accident, especially since you can barley see now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Knowing she's right) If you insist</p>

<div class="stage">The two get into Morrigan's Mustang and take off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> So, where were you going to in such a hurry?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why were you speeding?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Um, the results of an experiment just came in and I was on my way to go read them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Must be some experiment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's important, yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> So, where do you need me to take you?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika thinks for a moment as Morrigan's cell phone rings off again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHO KEEPS BOTHERING ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Maybe if you answered it, you'd find out</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan glares at Erika and reluctantly picks up her phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yeah, what do you want? - HEY, HEY, HEY GRACIE, SLOW DOWN... WHAT? - NO, THAT CAN'T BE, I WAS JUST THERE - OH MY GOD, WAS ANYONE HURT? - OH MY GOD - OK, I'LL MEET YOU THERE</p>

<div class="stage">The car swerves into a sharp u-turn and speeds off down the road. Erika grabs on to the door handle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Dry mouth) Sorry about that, I need to get back to Saint Brendan's</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You're just finding out what happened there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> YOU KNEW?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It was on the news before I left</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't understand, the shooting must have happened right after I left</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Was anything strange going on there tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, just normal church business...</p>

<div class="stage">The thought of Joenne abruptly springs into Morrigan's mind, causing her cheeks to flush.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Noticing) What's wrong?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nothing... I need to get to the church, shall I drop you off along the way?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> No, just keep going</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Don't worry about me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Accelerating) Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Within minutes, they arrive at the scene. The entire street is covered with police, news crews and on-lookers. Padre Juan is performing the last rites on the fallen priest as he is loaded into the ambulance. Anita is comforting her parents and uncle as Kylee, Zach and Gracie question those around them. Morrigan runs over as Erika observes from a distance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Someone shot Father Greg</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is he going to be OK?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I don't think so - he was hit in the chest and the paramedics said he was unresponsive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (On the verge of tears) This is insane, I was just here!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> It happened right after you left</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Was it a robbery? - did anyone see what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Overwhelmed) No... I... I don't think so</p>

<div class="stage">Kylee forces her way into a live stand-up report as Gracie assists Walls and Rubin with technical duties. Lieutenant Fiore barges over to them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> OK, IT IS TIME FOR ALL OF YOU MEDIA DOGS TO BACK THE HELL OFF AND GIVE THESE PEOPLE A MOMENT TO BREATHE - LET THE PROPER AUTHORITIES DO THEIR JOB</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Are you a &quot;proper authority,&quot; Fiore?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Fuck you, Isaacson!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Sobbing) Anita, please</p>

<div class="stage">A detective walks over to Frank to discuss a few things. The gun, sealed in a clear plastic bag, is in his possession.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> (Holding it up) Mr. Fiore, is this the weapon you found?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Yes, yes... that's it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> And where exactly did you find it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> On the stairs right outside of the church, I pointed out where to the other officer... I picked it up without thinking, I'm sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> That's alright, Sir, but we'll need to contact you for more information</p>

<div class="stage">Recognizing the distinctive wooden handle of the .45 revolver, Morrigan rushes over to them.</div>
