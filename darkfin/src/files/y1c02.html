<div class="stage">Inside the von Meer family estate on Beacon Point, a blonde woman is sprawled out on the Italian marble floor of her bathroom
    with a small, bleeding gash on her lower left shin. Lying naked in a pool of her own vomit, she shivers and struggles
    to regain consciousness. The woman slowly rises and stumbles over to the sink where she checks the watch she left on
    the counter top.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika von Meer</span> (Gasping) A... marked... improvement</p>

<div class="stage">After splashing her face repeatedly with cold water, Erika begins to chant a Pali prayer as she cleans up and closes the
    opened window.</div>

<div class="stage">Later that morning, the family begins to gather around a long, mahogany dining table for breakfast.
    <a href="../people.html#kjsr">Karl von Meer</a> sits at the head, reading a newspaper, while his son
    <a href="../people.html#kj">KJ</a>, piles his plate high with eggs, bacon, and more.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Pass me the muffins, would you, son?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Doing so) Here you go, Dad</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> I see someone left a gift for you out front</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> The trailer, I know, I'll take care of it after breakfast</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Returning to his paper) No problem</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Oh, I almost forgot, I'm working with
    <a href="../people.html#ona">Ona Rosa</a> on a pro bono case today and then I'm off to practice, do you mind if we go over the office stuff tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> KJ, you promised you'd help out - this is a family business and I want my family involved</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Dad, we're worth over $300,000,000 - no matter what happens, I think we're going to be OK - the charity cases
    I work on involve people who don't know where their next paycheck is coming from</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> I think you just like working with Ona Rosa</p>

<div class="stage">KJ does not respond.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Peering at his son over the paper) She's married with three kids... hands off!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I resent your implication, Dad - I enjoy her company because she is a very smart, very compassionate woman...
    unlike the usual bevy of the airheads I'm surrounded with daily</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> It doesn't stop you from dating them, does it?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Hell no - that's why I spend my weekends with a smart, married woman</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Shuffling his paper) Fine, I'll just get Erika to help me with the business today - where is she?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I heard the shower running when I came down</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Doesn't that girl spend enough time in the water?</p>

<div class="stage">Pauline von Meer, in her tennis whites, comes charging into the room.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Could someone please explain to me why in the hell there is a U-Haul in the front yard?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Mouth half full) 'Morning, Mom - Gracie left it but she didn't say why on her message</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Taking her seat) Gracie, I should've known - I still don't know why you hang around that creature</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Gracie is NOT a creature, she's my friend</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Pouring herself a cup of black coffee) She's a fat Oriental midget with eight fingers - that constitutes
    &quot;creature&quot; in my book</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Mother, I will not let your racism ruin my enjoyment of this beautiful blueberry muffin</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Looking at her gold and platinum watch) I have a match with that whore
    <a href="../people.html#ursula">Ursula</a> in less than a half hour, WHERE IS MY GODDAMN FRUIT COCKTAIL?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Leaning over and kissing his wife's cheek) Good morning, Darling</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Returning it) You have butter on your chin, Dear</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> It could be on worse places</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Heh</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Karl John, do not be vulgar at the breakfast table</p>

<div class="stage">Erika von Meer quietly enters the room and takes her seat. She wearily pours herself a cup of licorice spice tea and takes
    two slices of dry toast.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Good morning, Duchess</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Thank you for finally honoring us with your presence</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Mother</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Is it really asking too much to have my children share breakfast with their parents once a week?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika and KJ exchange glances with each other.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Mom, Rikka just turned 30 and I'm not far behind, when are you going to stop referring to us as children?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking at her brother) Maybe when you stop spilling jam all over your shirt, Kage</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Heh</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Listen, I suffered through a combined 47 hours of labor for you both - you two will ALWAYS be my children</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> What if it had only been 46?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Turning to her daughter) Honey, you look like shit!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Thank you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Rough night at the lab, Sis?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Slowly sipping her tea) You could say that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Well, it certainly wasn't with a man, poor Griffin has been leaving you messages on the hour</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> My own living cuckoo clock</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Are you going to return them?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Maybe</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Honest to God, Erika, I just don't get you</p>

    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Leaning back in his chair) Here we go</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Not looking up from her tea) And what exactly is it you don't get, Mother?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> You</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes, you've already established that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Reading the sports section) I see the Cactus finally won one</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I know, I was at the game with a couple of buddies</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Ignoring the men) I wasn't blessed with your physical gifts - I had to work twice as hard on the tour
    to succeed</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> So you've told us... countless times</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Did you see Doug at the game?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Nope</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Erika, you could've been a fashion model, an Olympic athlete... you could've been so much more!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> &quot;Could've&quot; - you talk like I'm already in the grave</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Aren't you?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika folds her arms and looks away.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I did score with one of the cheerleaders</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> A &quot;Cactus Flower?&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Yep</p>

<div class="stage">The women continue to ignore them.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> You stick yourself away in a dreary lab, all hours of the day and night - and for what? - SAVING FISH?
    - NO ONE GIVES A FLYING FUCK ABOUT FISH</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT I DO IN THE LAB BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE TO EVEN BEGIN TO COMPREHEND
    IT</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> OH, I GET IT, I'M A DUMB JOCK - I CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY DAUGHTER'S SUPER-SMART WORLD OF NUMBERS AND TEST
    TUBES AND LAB COATS - OOOOOOH</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> We made out in the parking lot behind left field</p>

    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE EARTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE HERE, WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S
    A BLUE FISH, OR A RED FISH, OR AN ECRU FISH - FIND SOMETHING BETTER TO DO WITH YOUR TIME</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> RIGHT, LIKE CHASE A FUZZY YELLOW BALL AROUND SOME WHITE LINES</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> On the topic of colors, she had pink nipples instead of red ones</p>

<p>Both women in unison: SHUT UP, KJ</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I LOVE SATURDAY BREAKFAST</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Heh</p>

<div class="stage">Pauline's cell phone rings as everyone takes a breath.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> Hello? - Ursula, Sweetie, are you ready for our match? - WHAT? - AGAIN? - how utterly dreadful, you poor
    thing!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> What?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Holding her hand over the phone) More bodies were found on the beach this morning, just a few houses
    down from them</p>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Claudia, at approximately six o'clock this morning, the bodies of three local men were discovered on
    the southern shore of Celoso Beach by a Coast Guard patrol unit -- although it appears that the men drowned, officials
    have not confirmed the cause of death and declined further comment -- family members of the victims will be notified
    shortly -- according to area residents, there were no signs of a disturbance during the night or in the early morning
    hours, however, because of dense fog, no one can say for sure -- since April of last year, six other bodies have been
    found on area beaches, ranging from Chaparral Heights to Beacon Point -- whether these three are related has yet to be
    determined -- officials from the Coast Guard, along with the Quartz County Sheriff, will be holding a joint press conference
    later this evening, you can be certain we'll have more details on this tragedy for you then -- as for Celoso Beach, it
    will remain closed until further notice... Morrigan McBride, KCON NewsCenter 8</p>

    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Catching her) How do you know this belongs to a woman?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika thinks for a second and then quickly points to a box full of cosmetics and bag of tampons.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Purely circumstantial</p>

<div class="stage">Erika goes over to the belongings and picks up a pink octopus with little red hearts all over it.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Squeezing it) Cute</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Ooh... this is really beautiful</p>

<div class="stage">Holding his hand up, KJ displays a strand of rosary beads.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Studying it) That's Belleek porcelain, be very very careful, Kage</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> What are these symbols?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Celtic knots - now, put it away, this is beyond trespassing!</p>

<div class="stage">Following his sister's orders, he does, and then checks the final box.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> OH WOW, IT'S HER</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> That new chick on the news this morning, Morrigan</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> McBride</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Here's her diploma - she's a Cal. State graduate - and here's a bunch of journalism awards... what does this
    one say?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking the plaque from her brother) &quot;Hinc quam sic calamus saevior ense, patent.&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I know it's Latin but what does it mean?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> You're a lawyer, you should know Latin</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> I only know what I need to know like &quot;fellatio&quot; - now, what does the damn thing say?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword.&quot;</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> BORING - I was hoping for a Satanic chant of some kind</p>

<div class="stage">As KJ's pager goes off, Erika suddenly notices a spot of blood and scales on the ragged edge of the trailer's metal bumper.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> (Looking at his pager) Speak of the devil, it's Gracie - she'll be by in a little bit to pick up the trailer</p>

<div class="stage">Carefully, the sister takes out a tissue and wipes up the stain without her brother noticing.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Slipping the tissue into her pocket) Can we please get going now?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">KJ</span> Sure - give me a few minutes to get this into the garage and out of Mom's sight, and then we'll take off</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> One more thing... I need to make a quick stop on the way to pay a bill</p>

<div class="stage">Awhile later, Erika enters the lab at Santa Conchita University where
    <a href="../people.html#shelby">Shelby Willis</a> is conducting an experiment.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Good morning, Shel</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Removing protective goggles) Oh, there's that look, I see that look - that's the look of &quot;I just
    had breakfast with my whole stinking family&quot; look!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Putting on her lab coat) How perceptive of you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Girl, you better not be bringing that look anywhere near me, I am having too good of a day for that!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Going over her) Good news on the kelp tests?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> GREAT NEWS ON THE KELP TESTS, TAKE A LOOK</p>

<div class="stage">The two go over the data.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Excellent results on the Giant Kelp... you might have to recheck the Understory Kelp, however</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> I realize that - why else do you think I'm here on a Saturday?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Because you love me?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> AHA - you are a good girl but no amount of love can bring me into work on a weekend</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Smiling) Except for results like these</p>

<div class="stage">The two chuckle and continue their work</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> So, did you hear about the dead men on Celoso Beach?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Does this involve a priest, a rabbi, and a sailor?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> This is not a joke</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Oh</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Captain Craig just called</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Uh-huh</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> It turns out one of the men was a father of a girl in my son's school</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> That's a shame</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Anyway, he wants to talk to you about the situation</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> As usual</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> The press will, as well</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rubbing her forehead) Sandy can play &quot;Dr. Soundbite&quot; for the university today</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Aren't you feeling well, Erika?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Not you, too</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Forgive me for giving a monkey's crap!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> No, it's just... I'm a little tired</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - SPEND YOUR WEEKEND RESTING OR HAVING FUN... NOT WORKING</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I could say the same to you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Taking off her lab coat) I'm heeding that very advice and leaving</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Kage needs you at polo practice today</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Captain Craig already asked me, that's where I'm going now - you should, too!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Preparing some beakers) No thanks, I need to do this</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Very well then, I'll see you Monday</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Goodbye, Shel</p>

<div class="stage">A few moments later, after making sure she's alone, Erika closes the blinds and locks the lab door. Taking out a syringe,
    she draws blood from herself and then collects a urine sample. Later in the day, she takes out a black &amp; white speckled
    log book from her leather satchel, everything inside is written in Prakrit.</div>


<div class="stage">
    <b>&nbsp;&quot;ERIKA'S JOURNAL&quot;</b>

    <p>Complete Morph #24</p>


    <p>WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT: 6.84 x10E3/uL
        <br> RED BLOOD CELL COUNT: 4.38 x10E6/uL
        <br> HEMOGLOBIN: 12.0 g/dL
        <br> HEMATOCRIT: 37.1%
        <br> SODIUM: 137 mmol/L
        <br> POTASSIUM: 3.5 mmol/L
        <br> CO2 CONTENT: 25 ol/L
        <br> ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE: 98 U/L</p>


    <p>After total saltwater submersion, the morph occured within 6.4 seconds, compared to the last one at 7.1 seconds. Mean
        water temperature was 59 F. Total time of the morph was approximately 3 hours without a resubmergence. The recovery
        time continues to lessen, however, dehydration is still a problem.</p>


    <p>Personal Note: I'm not as dizzy today but slight nausea and a transient migraine persist. I remember all of my actions
        while transmogrified. Part of me wishes I didn't. The charge of my trident continues to be an issue. Unfortunately,
        electrical engineering is not my forte. A larger issue looms, and her name is Morrigan McBride. I'm almost certain
        that she was unaware of my presence but I cannot be entirely sure. Further observation is required.</p>

<div class="stage">The lab phone rings simultaneously with Erika's cell phone. The woman lets them ring for half a dozen times and then finally
    picks one up.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Hello, Griffin</p>

    <span class="actor">Griffin</span> Say yes, say yes, I know you want to, say yes!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> If I agree, will you leave me alone until then?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Griffin</span> YES</p>

    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Alright, pick me up around 5:30 - goodbye, Griffin</p>

<div class="stage">Inside his stately, Neoclassic office,
    <a href="../people.html#griffin">Griffin Martel</a> leans back in his chair with a smug smile. His assistant, a large Samoan man, enters carrying an athletic
    bag and polo mallet.</div>
