      <h1>Year 3, Chapter 12: Myth Understanding</h1>
      <p>On his way to the cabin, Tim is confronted by belligerent deputies. Morrigan awakens and realizes Darkfin knocked her out to keep her from discovering her identity. They finally have the chance to discuss Duquesa Bay, Nereidium, and other mysteries, one-on-one. A disguised Erika finds a way to distract the deputy at the door while Morrigan hides in the bathroom. Tim arrives at the cabin and rummages for the black bag.</p>

<div class="stage">A cherry-red Jeep speeds its way up a winding road into 
 the Don Alessandro Mountains. Inside is Tim Hajanian. A satellite phone 
 is pressed to his ear and a cigarette to his lips.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> This is an ecological nightmare on so many levels - Quartz 
 Lake is forever changed...</p>

<div class="stage">He takes one final drag and tosses the butt out the window.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Still no sign of Erika? - damn - this is all so crazy 
 - let me know the minute you hear something, I'll be back at SCU in 
 a few hours - okay, bye, Shelby</p>

<div class="stage">A deep sigh is followed by the dialing of numbers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> C'mon, Geo, pick up, pick up - FUCKING VOICE MAIL - George, 
 this is Tim, it would be oh so comforting to hear your voice right now... 
 I miss you, hope you're okay</p>

<div class="stage">Tim throws the phone down on the seat next to him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Son of a bitch, I'm so tired of being there only when 
 he wants it - this has got to stop</p>

<div class="stage">He slows his speeds and pulls off on the shoulder. The 
 view overlooks the entire Santa Conchita Valley with Mount Wiggins' 
 thin trail of smoke fading in the distance.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c12_tim_jeep.jpg" h="495" w="510"/>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> It's time to go, it's past time to go - I'm getting the 
 bag from the cabin and hoping on the next flight to Guam</p>

<div class="stage">Tim pulls out and drives a little further up the road. 
 He's in the process of lighting another cigarette when three Eddington 
 County sheriff vehicles block the road ahead.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Quickly extinguishing the cigarette) Shit!</p>

<div class="stage">Three officers sporting moustaches and aviator shades 
 quickly glance at each other as Tim stops. The oldest struts over to 
 the jeep.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Good day, officer, is there a problem?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Do you have business here, sir?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> My brother's cabin is five miles up the road - I needed 
 to fetch some gear</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Can I see your license and registration, please?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Opening his wallet) Um, sure - why is this road closed 
 off if you don't mind me asking?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Are you unaware of the events of last night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Oh, I'm quite aware, officer - but we are well past the 
 volcano's radius over here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> We don't know that for sure, now do we?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Actually, we kinda do - see, I work at SCU and...</p>

<div class="stage">The officer looks to his buddies and they start to come 
 over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Right... anyway, I'll just be five minutes, that's all, 
 I swear!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Sorry, no one goes past this point</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Why is Eddington County blocking the road?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> You sure like asking questions, don't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> It's in my nature to be curious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Well, Mister Hag...gidgin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Hajanian</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Now is not the time to be curious - the Santa Conchita 
 sheriffs are a little busy right now and we're helping out... that's 
 all you need to know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Look, I have a deputy friend at Santa Conchita - if I 
 call him up, he can vouch for me - I really need to get my gear from 
 the cabin!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Shoving the license back at him) TURN YOUR VEHICLE 
 AROUND, SIR</p>

<div class="stage">Tim thinks for a moment. The other two deputies take 
 a defensive posture.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Okay, okay</p>

<div class="stage">Tim reluctantly swings a U-turn and heads back down the 
 road.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Have a nice day!</p>

<div class="stage">About a mile later, out of earshot and visual range, 
 Tim takes the Jeep off road and heads back in the direction of the cabin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> FUCK YOU, PIGS, YOU CAN SUCK MY ASS... on second thought, 
 noo</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside the cabin, shafts of daylight stream through the 
 holes in the window shades. Morrigan, dressed in an oversized camouflage 
 shirt, is asleep on a fold-a-way sofa in the middle of the room. Her 
 body is covered with a wool blanket and her eyes are blindfolded with 
 a red-striped necktie.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Stirring) Uhh... ow, my head - I'M BLIND, I'M BLIND</p>
<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c12_morri_bound.jpg" h="502" w="610"/>

<div class="stage">Wearing a black silk robe with a Japanese character embroidered 
 on the pocket, Erika steps over from the kitchen, sipping some tea.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Deepening her tone) Relax, Morrigan, you are not blind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Trying not to panic) WHO ARE YOU? - WHY ARE MY HANDS 
 AND FEET TIED UP?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You know who this is... and why I have to keep you restrained</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Please remind me again before I SCREAM MY FREAKING 
 LUNGS OUT</p>

<div class="stage">Erika brushes a comforting hand against the side of Morrigan's 
 cheek. The touch causes McBride to ease.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Fin? - is that you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You sound weird... yet familiar</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Take slow, deep breaths</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What... what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Breathe, Morrigan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I'm breathing, I'm breathing already - will you tell 
 me what's going on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You know what happened and why this is the result</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is silent for a moment trying to recall everything.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What time is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It is afternoon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> AFTERNOON? - are we still at the cabin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I was... I was going to the bathroom and... ooh!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I told you not to come inside - you chose to ignore 
 my request and picked the lock</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Gasping) I saw...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I had to do what was necessary to protect us both</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> A woman... a human</p>

<div class="stage">Erika gets up and paces the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I... I didn't see your face, just an outline of a 
 body</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I could not allow you to see my face - I threw the shower 
 curtain over you and rendered you unconscious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> YOU KNOCKED ME OUT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I did what I had to do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> OH MY GOD, HOW COULD YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> How could I not? - now, if we are through with your 
 childish histrionics, maybe we can speak normally</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Are you the one that's hogtied and blindfolded taking 
 to a... a... I don't know what to call you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Fin seems to be working rather well and I had to secure 
 you so there would be no more surprises like last night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Okay, I'm sorry I picked the lock - could you please 
 untie me now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I am still in an altered state - you cannot see me this 
 way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Fine, let's make a deal - untie my arms and legs 
 and I'll keep my blindfold on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You expect me to trust you to keep your hands from whipping 
 off the blindfold the minute I release them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Damn, are you a lawyer?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika goes over to the closet and searches through it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You have a very valid point, I understand - BUT MY 
 FEET ARE KILLING ME - isn't it bad enough I had to go through this with 
 The Clergy?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika finds a balaclava and slips it over her head. She 
 now dons fishing waders and a hooded parka.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Fin... are you there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Trying to find boots that will fit her) Right here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Why is your voice now muffled?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I am trying to find a solution for you</p>

<div class="stage">Erika finishes with a pair of gloves and goes over to 
 untie Morrigan's feet and hands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Sighing) Uh, that works... thank you</p>

<div class="stage">Erika is deliberately standing in back of Morrigan as 
 she slowly sits up and stretches out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I want you to know you have my word and I will not 
 remove this blindfold</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Good, because I cannot stay dressed like this for very 
 long - it is too warm, not to mention hideously unattractive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Turning around) Can I see?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Your word?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Turning back again) Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I would simply retreat to the bathroom again and barricade 
 the door better... but we need to discuss matters</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I agree, we definitely need to talk - but I definitely 
 need to pee - lead me there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Taking her hand) This way</p>

<div class="stage">Erika directs Morrigan to the bathroom and closes the 
 door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Let me know when you are finished</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Through the door) Could you please get me a glass 
 of water while I'm doing this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Of course</p>

<div class="stage">Erika goes into the kitchen and takes down a metal mug 
 from the cupboard. A pounding at the door startles her and the mug goes 
 clanking into the sink.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> HELLO, THIS IS THE SHERRIFF - OPEN UP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Perfect</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> WE HEARD SOMEONE INSIDE, WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Stripping off her clothes) Um... I'LL BE RIGHT THERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> NOW</p>

<div class="stage">Wearing nothing but the silk robe, Erika answers the 
 door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Yes?</p>

<div class="stage">One of the younger Eddington County officers from earlier 
 is standing outside. He takes in the full view of Erika before he responds.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Smirking) Good day, ma'am - are you the owner of 
 this residence?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Leaning in a seductive manner) No, sir - it belongs 
 to my boyfriend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Peering inside) Is he here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No, I am waiting for him to... come</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Leering at her breasts) I bet you are... I need to 
 see some I.D.</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Is there a problem?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Not at this time but we are suggesting that those 
 in this area pack up their belongings and leave</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Huh, I was under the impression that it was only a voluntary 
 evacuation?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Brushing himself against her leg) Technically, it 
 is - but we wouldn't want a pretty thing like you to get all melted 
 if the mountain blows again</p>

<div class="stage">Erika quickly glances back at the bathroom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Her robe now falls open) It blew really long and hard 
 last night</p>
<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c12_erika_robe.jpg" h="409" w="500"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Not hiding the bulge in his pants) Oh, yeah</p>

<div class="stage">Again, Erika glances back at the bathroom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> Is there someone else here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No... I was getting ready for a bath when you arrived 
 - I do not want the water to spill over - get the wood floor all wet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> I'll let you get back to that but first I need to 
 see some I.D.</p>

<div class="stage">Erika drops her robe to the ground and slowly turns around.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> As you can see, I have nothing on me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Now leaning against the door) I can see that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I was so busy gathering candles and wine and lotion, 
 I forgot to bring my purse</p>

<div class="stage">The officer's only response is heavy breathing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> And since I have no wallet, no pockets, I am afraid 
 I have no identification</p>

<div class="stage">Erika now presses up against him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> But I see you have plenty of pockets</p>

<div class="stage">Her hand slides inside one and grabs hold.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> May I pull out your badge?</p>

<div class="stage">The officer's face is now red and sweaty as he gasps.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Working him furiously) I wish to stay at this cabin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Getting ready to climax) I'm still... making up... 
 my mind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Give me and my boyfriend until tomorrow... please?</p>

<div class="stage">Another sheriff's vehicle turns up the road and honks. 
 The officer quickly backs off as his knees start to buckle. He catches 
 himself and walks stiff-legged away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Officer</span> (Wiping his face) You have until nightfall</p>

<div class="stage">Erika shuts the door behind her and watches him leave 
 from the window. She now runs over to the sink and scrubs her hands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Still in the bathroom) Fin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> DO NOT COME OUT YET</p>

<div class="stage">Erika grabs the balaclava and a blanket and disguises 
 herself the best she can. She goes over to the bathroom and opens the 
 door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Did you bring my water?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Sighs) No... I was preoccupied</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I heard voices - they were real, voices - right?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Unfortunately so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I stayed inside, I stayed quiet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You did not peek outside?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I wanted to but the blindfold stayed on - I promised 
 you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Good, thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Now, if there was screaming, all bets would have 
 been off</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I would hope so</p>

<div class="stage">Erika leads her back to the sofa.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We have to be out of here before tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Just as I was getting used to this crap hole</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> But we still have enough time... to talk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Okay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Let me go get you your water - anything else?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> The truth, all of it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> As much as I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You know plenty</p>

<div class="stage">Erika brings the water over and takes a seat next to 
 the still blindfolded Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> So... what's your favorite music?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You are human, so you must have human likes and dislikes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We do not have enough time to discuss my likes and dislikes 
 - we need to cover the essentials</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I think that's pretty essential in understanding 
 you better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It is not me you need to understand - what did you learn 
 when you were with The Clergy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> That I'm special... but not pure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> That I'm a living treasure map and my mom and Joe 
 Tiszo - both dead - communicate with my thoughts somehow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Interesting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Father Greg is... was one of them... us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> That does not surprise me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Oh, and that my supposed friend Amy is one of them 
 and that candle-lighting bok choi-eating landlord bitch backstabbed 
 me... and Zach - dear God, PLEASE let him be alive!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> What else?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You're not like us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You confound The Clergy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> And me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> What I do not understand is why they keep me alive - 
 they could have easily killed me if they really wanted to</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I know, but you have something they want... or need</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> They have had several opportunities to take my trident</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> It goes beyond the trident - they want you... alive</p>

<div class="stage">Erika reflects on this for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> And, so do I</p>

<div class="stage">Erika gets up and takes a seat across the room with her 
 arms folded.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Do you remember exactly what happened before I found 
 you in the river?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> The Leader, the one in the white robe, used me to 
 find the exact location of the Nereidium - Joe sacrificed himself to 
 save me...</p>

<div class="stage">Erika bows her head in sorrow. Morrigan falls silent 
 as tears run past the blindfold. Erika takes some tissue and stands 
 in back of Morrigan. She removes the tie from her eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What are you doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Gently wiping Morrigan's eyes) I trust you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> About time</p>

<div class="stage">Fully wrapped in the blanket and with the balaclava covering 
 her head, Erika takes her seat. Morrigan can't help but look but there 
 is no telling who Darkfin is.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Your turn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> From what I have been able to gather, The Clergy are 
 a meta/super - whatever prefix you want to use - hominid that diverged 
 from our lineage and evolved on their own</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> So, they evolved faster than us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> &quot;Faster&quot; is not the right term except for 
 a Sigma7 script - these hominids look like us and act like us but they 
 were performing organ transplants while our ancestors were inventing 
 the wheel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Aw, I knew I should have paid better attention in 
 biology!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> There is a theory that they are tied to extra terrestrial 
 beings but I highly doubt that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I have a hard time believing in little green men from 
 Mars</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I never believed in big green mermaids from the sea 
 either so I'm not ruling anything out</p>

<div class="stage">Erika can't help but chortle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> If these homonyms...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Hominids</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Whatever - were so super, why aren't they ruling 
 the planet right now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Who says they are not?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan loses the color in her face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I do not know the extent of their infiltration but there 
 is only a limited number of their species - according to Sam's ancient 
 text, there was a great virus approximately 30,000 years ago that wiped 
 out over 90% of The Clergy yet all other creatures were immune - in 
 order for them to survive, they could no longer isolate themselves and 
 had to interbreed with Homo erectus... regular humans</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Guess who's coming to dinner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> The offspring are known as &quot;Taints&quot; since 
 they are not of pure stock</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> How can any of them be pure since they had to mix 
 in?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It is a sliding scale of purity - think of alcohol in 
 beverages, 20 proof as opposed to 80 proof - their robes denote the 
 level of their purity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> So, a brown robe is melon liqueur but the white robe 
 is straight Smirnoff?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Something like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Why do they call themselves The Clergy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Humans came up with that name - although similar to 
 Latin, their language existed long before, it parallels Sanskrit - no 
 one knows for sure what they call themselves</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I do...</p>

<div class="stage">Erika is frozen in her seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I heard it - from my mother, Joe... what overtook 
 me last night - I can't, I can't even pronounce it</p>

<div class="stage">The tears reappear as Morrigan becomes flustered. Erika 
 goes over to her side and the two sit close to each other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It is not important right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> The Clergy have nothing to do with human religion?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Not exactly - they have a mythos and ceremonies surrounding 
 it are similar to the world's great religions but it is based on the 
 Nereidium, not mono or polytheism - science will ultimately be their 
 downfall as well, we simply need to catch up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You hope</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It is strictly a matter of time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I know you've told me a little bit about this Nereidium 
 before but, forgive me, I didn't really pay attention in chemistry either 
 - what is the big deal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It is the rarest substance on earth - it is the most 
 powerful substance on earth - even the smallest amount is highly sought 
 after</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Gasping) The clasp on the Duquesa's Tears!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Correct - that is why it was stolen, the pearls were 
 irrelevant</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> God, it seems so long ago yet like yesterday at the 
 same time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> There are trace elements of Nereidium in Clergy blood 
 and Clergy blood only</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> So, that's how I can control your trident?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Part of the reason</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What's the rest?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Science</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I should have seen that coming</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> As part of their ritual and foretold in their writings, 
 The Clergy had to wait for the day when a &quot;Marked One&quot; would 
 arrive and pinpoint the exact location of the Nereidum vain here in 
 Duquesa Bay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Why this place? - why me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> The vein in the Indian Ocean is too deep and an unsuccessful 
 attempt to reach it years ago nearly ended up wrecking the biosphere</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Were you there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Pausing) The vein off the coast of Ireland is too weak 
 and has become corrupted - why you? - I am still trying to understand 
 the specifics</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Answer my other question... were you there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Voice cracking) Yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> That's how Sam died?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan reaches for Erika's hand but she resists.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Sniffling) A select few in our government know about 
 The Clergy - there is a whole black ops unit devoted to keeping an eye 
 on them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Joenne!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> They were hoping to discover the vein first and use 
 the Nereidium against them but that is moot now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Disgusted) Huh, everyone can't wait to kill each 
 other</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> The Nereidium will be used as a weapon of mass destruction, 
 but it will also be used as a tool of infinite creation to keep the 
 humans dead or under control - The Clergy will finally be able to fulfill 
 their destiny</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> At the expense of everyone and everything else?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Essentially, yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Okay... if they were forced to get it on with ordinary 
 folk to survive, surely they must have developed feelings for us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You know how a farmer adores his prized pig but will 
 not hesitate to slaughter it when necessary?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Standing) I REFUSE TO BECOME BACON - WHY HASN'T 
 THE MEDIA EXPOSED THIS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I believe you can answer that question better than I 
 can</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan groans and rubs her face as she plops back down 
 next to Erika.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> As much as I'd like to go back to worrying about 
 car payments and what to get for my coworker's baby shower, it's not 
 going to happen... is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> That seems less and less likely</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Can all of this be stopped?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Stopped? - no - altered, maybe... I actually have a 
 real issue about interfering with the natural evolution of The Clergy 
 but I also realize how powerful they are and what a detriment they would 
 be to every other living creature if not kept in line</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> All of this is so much to digest... especially on 
 an empty stomach</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan gets up and heads over to the kitchen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Searching the cabinets) Cookies, I need cookies 
 - do you... can you eat cookies?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I prefer not to ingest processed foods but I technically 
 can</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Digging past a bag of beef jerky and a can of baked 
 beans) Well, you don't have much of a choice here</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan settles for a box of crackers and returns to 
 the sofa. She offers some to Erika but is politely refused.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> So, what about you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> What about me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I understand The Clergy a little better but I'm even 
 more confused about you</p>

<div class="stage">Erika responds with silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I guess that means no lost underwater kingdom of 
 Atlantis to escape to or other Aleta Oscuras to come rescue us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Damn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Sorry to disappoint</p>

<div class="stage">McBride focuses her gaze on the bird statue at the other 
 end of the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> That freaking bird is driving me nuts - where have 
 I seen it before?</p>

<div class="stage">A sudden thump outside causes both women to jump.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Whispering) Get in the bathroom!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan quickly follows instructions as Erika grabs 
 a hunting knife and scans outside the window. She spots the backside 
 of a man as he rummages through a utility shed.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Spotting a small black rucksack) There it is!</p>
