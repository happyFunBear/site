<div class="stage">Still woozy from being knocked out by Erika, Tim slowly 
 opens his eyes to see the same three deputies from Eddington County 
 looming above him on the front porch.</div>

<p a="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c14_tim.jpg" h="427" w="510"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Wh&mdash;where?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Older Deputy</span> Well, well, well &mdash; it's Mr. Hagidgin!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Startled) What did you do to me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Older Deputy</span> We haven't done anything&mdash; yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Younger Deputy</span> But I'm sure your girlfriend has done plenty</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Nearly choking on the words) GIRLFRIEND?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Other Deputy</span> Ray's stick can attest to that</p>

<div class="stage">The two men snicker and high five each other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Why am I in a robe on my porch?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Younger Deputy</span> She's a real kinky one, you lucky bastard</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Older Deputy</span> You know, I could have you arrested for not following 
 my orders earlier</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Other Deputy</span> Let's cut the guy some slack, I'd do the same 
 if I had a hot blonde like that waiting for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Younger Deputy</span> Especially since, well, since you don't seem 
 to be her type</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Hot blonde? &mdash; WOMAN? &mdash; um, no, this is all 
 wrong</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Older Deputy</span> Maybe you can enlighten us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> This is my brother Geoffrey Hajanian's cabin &mdash; you 
 can call him and check &mdash; you can look at my license again and 
 verify my name&mdash;</p>

<div class="stage">Tim reaches for his wallet and realizes he has nothing 
 except the robe.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> No way&mdash;</p>

<div class="stage">He runs over to the cabin door and it's locked.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Banging on it) MY KEYS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Younger Deputy</span> (Whispering to Tim) Is this some kind of role 
 playing thing? &mdash; think she'd be into a gang bang? &mdash; we already 
 have the uniforms</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> YOU NEED TO STEP AWAY FROM ME, NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Older Deputy</span> I'm getting tired of this, boys &mdash; I say 
 we take him in&mdash; exactly the way he is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> WHO THE HELL IS THIS BITCH?</p>

<div class="stage">Tim suddenly freezes up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> Blonde you say?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Other Deputy</span> Does she wear wigs?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Ignoring him) Erika&mdash; could it possibly be? &mdash; 
 why?</p>

<div class="stage">The shed in back of the cabin catches Tim's eye.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> OH MY GOD, SHE HAS MY BAG</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Younger Deputy</span> (Excited) What's in the bag?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Slamming his fist on the door) DAMMIT ALL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Older Deputy</span> I'm done with this, cuff him and bring him to 
 the station!</p>

<div class="stage">Before Tim can protest, the other deputy has him in custody 
 and his pushing him towards their car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Younger Deputy</span> What about his girl?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Older Deputy</span> I'll let you stay here for awhile and &quot;play&quot; 
 but bring her down when you're done</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Younger Deputy</span> Awesome!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Other Deputy</span> Why does he get to have all the fun?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Tim</span> (Muttering) I really hope it's you, Erika&mdash; or maybe 
 not</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Erika and Morrigan speed along the Santa Conchita riverbank 
 in Tim's Jeep. The soot in the air from the eruption creates a brilliant 
 orange sunset swirled with purple clouds.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Appreciative) Beautiful</p>

<div class="stage">Erika smiles beneath her balaclava.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It is nice to know you will always find the beauty, 
 no matter the situation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Raises an eyebrow at her) Or person</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Perhaps &quot;creature&quot; is more appropriate</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Perhaps &quot;human&quot; is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We are almost there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I would feel better if you came with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I will return for you but there are matters that need 
 taking care of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I know, you need to revert or morph or whatever it 
 is you do to become a Sea Monkey</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> The proper term is transmogrification</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Didn't I mention earlier how I forgot to pay attention 
 in biology?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I seem to recall that</p>

<div class="stage">The Jeep slows and pulls off into an oak grove.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You will have to walk it the rest of the way, you are 
 only about a quarter mile from your home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Stepping out of the jeep) HOUSE&mdash; that place 
 was never really a home, now more than ever</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> But it is the safest place for you right now</p>

<div class="stage">Erika motions to Tim's black bag.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Be sure to take it with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> NUH-UH, I do NOT need that added worry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It might be useful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Then you use it, not me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Fine, we have no time to argue</p>

<div class="stage">Erika starts to get out of the jeep.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> What are you doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Walking you to your door</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> This has been a really wild date but you don't have 
 to walk with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I want to make sure&mdash;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> NO &mdash; I said I'll be fine!</p>

<div class="stage">Erika is a little stunned.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Just like the president and the vice president are 
 rarely in the same room, it's better this way&mdash; in case something 
 should happen to one of us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We will be fine but you are correct in playing it safe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Moving closer to Erika) Besides, the quicker you 
 do what needs to be done, the quicker you come back to me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Agreed &mdash; I need to find the trident and then I'll 
 return to the bay &mdash; expect me in the morning</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Do you want chicken eggs or salmon eggs?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I want you to relax and try to remember as much as you 
 can about what happened with The Clergy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I wish I could forget</p>

<div class="stage">Erika places a comforting arm around Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Amethyst is no threat to you&mdash; when she returns, 
 ask her about her father</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan grabs Erika's arm and gently feels it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Sweet smile) Fin has skin&mdash; who knew?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika can't find the words as Morrigan starts to walk 
 off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> We still need to talk more&mdash; later</p>
<p a="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c14_erika.jpg" h="469" w="540"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Heavy Metal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Halting) What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You asked me before what my favorite kind of music was&mdash; 
 I enjoyed heavy metal at one time</p>

<div class="stage">Erika hops back in the jeep and takes off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Watching) Why did I think it would be Yanni?</p>

<div class="stage">Miles down the road, Erika grabs the satellite phone 
 and dials.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Speaking French) Connect me to the Meeramar Zurich 
 office please&mdash; hello, Chantal, this is Erika &mdash; yes, I am 
 fine, thank you - I need you to convey a message to my brother&mdash;</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">KJ and Griffin speed through the mountains in a limo. 
 Griffin is chattering away on his satellite phone as a bleary-eyed KJ 
 slumps in his seat and tries to collect his thoughts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> (Into phone) Yes, father &mdash; I understand &mdash; 
 we'll be there shortly</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin clicks off the phone and pours KJ and himself 
 a brandy.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Refusing it) I couldn't be anymore numb and still function</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> I just need you to function for a few more hours</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Care to explain to me why we're headed in the direction 
 of the volcano?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> We need to be there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Okaaay</p>

<div class="stage">KJ leans forward and taps on the window partition.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Driver, turn around and take me back to Duquesa Bay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> What are you doing? &mdash; DRIVER, IGNORE MR. VON 
 MEER'S REQUEST</p>

<div class="stage">KJ lunges at Griffin and grabs him in a headlock.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> DRIVER, DO AS I SAY &mdash; I HAVE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH 
 OF YOU, GRIF &mdash; I NEED TO GO HOME TO MOM, WHO COULD VERY WELL BE 
 THE LAST OF MY FAMILY, AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY TO TELL ME 
 WHERE WE'RE GOING</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> (Gasping) I'LL TELL YOU, I'LL TELL YOU&mdash; LET 
 GO</p>

<div class="stage">KJ does as Griffin coughs and regains his breath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> God almighty, you're as bad as your sister</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? &mdash; I SWEAR, IF YOU HURT HER&mdash;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Bad choice of words, sorry &mdash; for the last time, 
 I love Erika more than my own life, I could never hurt her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Looking out the window) Then&mdash; where is she?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> (Patting his shoulder) We'll find her &mdash; I promise 
 &mdash; but we need to attend this meeting, first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Attend WHAT meeting? &mdash; for the last time, Griffin, 
 where in the hell are we going and why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Remember what I told you about the Nereidium?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Is that what this is for? &mdash; we're on a wild goose 
 chase for your magic rocks?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Actually, Kage, it's metal&mdash;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Rubbing his face) Aw, gimme a break!</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin's satellite phone rings and he answers it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Why, yes&mdash; yes, he's right here, hold on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Taking the phone) Who is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Chantal from Zurich</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> That's odd&mdash; hello, Chantal</p>

<div class="stage">KJ nearly leaps out of his seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> WHERE IS SHE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> ERIKA JUST SPOKE TO HER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> WHERE DID SHE CALL FROM?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> HOLD ON, HOLD ON&mdash; did she say anything else?</p>

<div class="stage">The limo enters a tunnel and the reception fades out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> HELLO, HELLO? &mdash; CHANTAL? &mdash; DAMMIT, GET OUT 
 OF THE TUNNEL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> We can't&mdash;</p>

<div class="stage">The limo continues on and then slows down as darkness 
 envelopes it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> We're here</p>

<div class="stage">The glowing eyes of several hooded figures approach the 
 limo windows.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">With twilight fading over the woods near Mount Wiggins, 
 Joenne Mirabello and her black ops unit patrol the area. Charred trees, 
 rocks and bodies litter the ground. She reverently touches the battle 
 fatigue tatters on a half skeleton/half corpse.</div>

<p a="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c14_joenne.jpg" h="569" w="460"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Into her radio) Looks like we've found Major Dawkins</p>

<div class="stage">One of her field agents points out an empty blue cloak 
 hanging from a tree.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> I wonder if that belonged to the bastard that got him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> Bag it, we need everything we can get from these freaks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> At least we got a few of them this time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Kicking a tree stump) Yeah, and we lost 27 of us in 
 the process</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> DC is expecting a report soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> Send the same one we've been sending all along &mdash; 
 The Clergy is getting closer to the Nereidium and we're still fucking 
 helpless against them!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> Do you want me to use those exact words?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> Be creative&mdash; and then go sweep the northern sector 
 &mdash; report back in ten minutes</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne ventures down to a grove near the banks of the 
 Santa Conchita River. She scans the area with her own eyes and then 
 with inferred goggles. Nothing. As she begins to leave, a sensor gauge 
 lets out a single ping.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Freezing) Hello!</p>

<div class="stage">She grabs her side arm and turns in the direction of 
 the reading. The pings grow louder and more frequent as she trots along.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Into her radio) ALL TEAMS, NEED ASSISTANCE AT ONCE, 
 LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES A STRAGGLER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> (Over the radio) ON OUR WAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> THE TARGET IS STATIONARY AND AT THE FOLLOWING COORDINATES&mdash;</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne is now running full bore. She snaps a green chemical 
 lightstick as darkness falls.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> I'M COMING FOR YOU, HOOD BOY</p>

<div class="stage">As she rounds an outcropping, she is amazed by the sight 
 of Darkfin's trident embedded in a rock with the body of a brown-robbed 
 Clergy member stuck beneath its prongs.</div>

<p a="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c14_clergy.jpg" h="428" w="510"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> HOLY SHIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> (Over the radio) AGENT MIRABELLO, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?</p>

<div class="stage">The trident now glows a soft orange, causing Joenne's 
 lightstick to match its color.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Half smile) Well now, where's your Mama?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> COME IN, JOENNE, DO YOU COPY?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Into her radio) I'M FINE &mdash; IT WAS A FALSE READING 
 &mdash; CANCEL THE BACKUP, REPEAT, CANCEL THE BACKUP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> In that case, we could use your help over here &mdash; 
 we've spotted a civilian vehicle approaching on a fire road</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> Is it the Jeep we spotted earlier?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> Negative &mdash; it's press&mdash; a KCON newsvan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> Aw, great!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> The Jeep went in the opposite direction but this is 
 coming straight at us &mdash; we need your order to fire&mdash;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> HOLD ON, I MIGHT KNOW THESE PEOPLE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> You know our directive about the media &mdash; we can't 
 let them get any closer!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> HOLD YOUR FIRE UNTIL I CHECK IT OUT FOR MYSELF, THAT'S 
 AN ORDER</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne casts a regretful look at the trident and then 
 runs off. She now approaches her fellow agent armed with an RPG launcher. 
 The KCON newsvan is in the crosshairs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> We cannot take the risk of them broadcasting any of 
 this &mdash; we need to eliminate them ASAP, chalk up the disappearance 
 to the volcano</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne takes a deep breath knowing there is no other 
 choice.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Bowing her head) Wait for them to cross the grove, 
 then fire</p>

<div class="stage">The van suddenly halts and cuts the motor. The driver's 
 door opens.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Looking through her scope) Wait&mdash; who is that?</p>

<div class="stage">A woman runs in their direction and yells.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> JOENNE, JOENNE, ARE YOU AROUND HERE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> JUSTINE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Agent</span> FIRE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Tackling the agent) NO, THAT'S MY SISTER</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Morrigan slips under the yellow police tape and sneaks 
 up to the back door of her darkened home. She takes a spare key from 
 under a loose roof tile and carefully goes inside. Making sure the window 
 shades are drawn, she checks each room and grabs a bottle of water from 
 the refrigerator.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Whispering) I'm starting to feel hot and cold again&mdash; 
 this is not good</p>

<div class="stage">A thought crosses her mind, causing her to spit water.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Tallulah</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan hurries into her bedroom. She lights a tiny 
 candle and peers through the glass of the terrarium at her pet tarantula. 
 She lets out a huge sigh of relief when she realizes the spider is still 
 alive. The candle blows out as quick gust of air rushes from behind.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amethyst</span> Don't worry, I took good care of her for you</p>
