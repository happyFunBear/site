<div class="stage">Inside Amethyst Hill's main house, Gracie, Zach, and Morrigan spend their evening gathered around a table, playing a hand of pinochle and snacking on some of Amy's homemade veggie chips.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Holding a cat up to the table and speaking in an accent) Roshumba opens the bid at 250</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Groaning at her cards) Pass</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Jump</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Getting up and dancing) FOR MY LOVE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Joining Zach) JUMP IN AND FEEL MY TOUCH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Wiggling his rear) IF YOU WANT TO TASTE MY KISSES IN THE NIGHT THEN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Dancing with the cat) JUMP JUMP FOR MY LOVE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Smiling) 80's songs!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Swear to God, Morri, if you join them, I will slaughter you where you sit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Back to Roshumba's accent) What is the matter, is Miss Grace not living up to her name today?</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v03_amy_cards.jpg" h="361" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I THOUGHT I was here to play cards</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Returning to his chair) And play, we shall!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Once again, Mr. Isaacson wins the most heinous t-shirt award!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Bowing) Thank you, thank you</p>

<div class="stage">On the front are the words &quot;Liquor in the Front&quot; and on the back are the words &quot;Poker in the Rear.&quot;</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Reading) I don't get it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Sound it out and read it slow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Still don't get it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's a play on words</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> We're writers, we get it</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie makes a face and flips them off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Massaging the cat's back with her foot) Gracie, I think you need an aura cleanse</p>

<div class="stage">The blonde rushes off and returns with a square candle, sets it in the middle of the table and lights it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> How about sparking me a joint instead?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (All smiles) Now, you're talking!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Firm) Not in my presence, please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I forgot, Saint McBride is in the room</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Roshumba agrees, now is not the proper time... sex needs to be involved</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I just love your pussy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> GUYS, PLEASE - I am totally wiped today - I spent last night DJ-ing a wedding - three solid hours of Barry Manilow, Journey, and Enya... I want to slit my wrists</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Did they make you play &quot;The Macarena&quot; or &quot;The Chicken Dance?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Both</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ooh, let's cut her some slack</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey, that reminds me, you'll never guess who's getting married</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Give me your hand, Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Doing so) Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Let me see if I can guess who it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Shrugging) OK</p>

<div class="stage">Amy passes her one hand over the candle while the other one squeezes Zach's hand tightly.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Closing her eyes and concentrating) Ah, I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Who is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> NOT YOU</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan chuckles as Gracie slumps over on the table and sighs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey, that's almost funny... almost</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> So, who is getting married?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> You don't know him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OK, just trying to keep the conversation going</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v03_morri_can.jpg" h="490" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Casting a sly look at Gracie) It's Jimmy the Skinny</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You have got to be kidding me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Now THAT is almost funny</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who is Jimmy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> This guy Gracie fucked at a party once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I did NOT fuck him... I blew him - there's a difference</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Where did Skinny meet this girl?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why is he called &quot;skinny?&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">All three look at Morrigan and ignore her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hey, I'm just curious
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Are you ready for this? - he met her at Bible Study!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You have GOT to be kidding me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> No, that is the primo place to meet chicks, next to the supermarket</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Huh, my coven has socials all the time, I wonder why we never meet any marriage-minded men?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Oh, I don't know, something about a bubbling caldron of bat's blood as a centerpiece instead of chips and salsa</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> It wasn't bat's blood... it was eye of newt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I don't get it, Jimmy is not even religious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> But he is ready to settle down, have someone do his laundry, and squeeze out a few kids</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Gulping her beer) So glad the apostles will assist him in achieving choice snatch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Yep, and if he's lucky, he might even score a virgin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I cannot believe what I am hearing!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Like he'd want to marry some party skank... sorry, Grace</p>

<div class="stage">Takanachi mock smiles and waves.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> See, ladies, it's like hunting - if you want to bag the trophy deer, you need to go to their territory, you don't wait for them to come down from the hills and land on the hood of your car
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Such a fitting image</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> That reminds me, I need to defrost the buck antlers</p>

<div class="stage">The blonde woman bounces up from the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I thought you were a vegetarian?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> They're not for eating</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> oookay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Turning to Morrigan) Well, Ms. Catholic, what is your opinion on the subject... or should I say, the Pope's opinion?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sipping her drink) Being Catholic, Jewish or Wiccan doesn't really matter - a union between two people should be based on mutual love and respect... not on the need to breed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Rubbing her head) Can we please change the subject, PLEASE? - who knows a good dog poop joke?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Aren't you feeling well, Gracie - you seem out of sorts?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> PMS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Right, PMS - the answer to everything</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Oh Amy, while you're up, grab me another beer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Get your own beer, Eyes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hey, she's already up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> No problem, another beer for you, Gracie?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Sure, why not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> How about you, Morri?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm fine with my Ginger Ale, thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Why don't you ever drink with us?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't like the taste of beer, it makes me gag along with the smell of Tide detergent and cheesy breadsticks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Well, there go your Christmas gifts</p>

<div class="stage">Amy returns with the beers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> KJ just called looking for you, Morri
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I hope you didn't tell him where I was</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Nope, I just took the message - he said this is like the 10th message he's left - why don't you call him back?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Staring at her cards) I've been busy</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Zach eye each other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Busy doing what?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Look, I don't feel like dealing with him and his Ona Rosa crush right now - I have other things to... occupy myself with</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> For one, the Pacific Coast Oil Cartel story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Ah, the good old &quot;peacock&quot; boys... have fun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> When I was younger, my dad used to rant about them all the time but I never knew or cared about what they did... until now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What about the OTHER story we're working on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Back burner for now, the PCOC conference is next week, I have a lot of research ahead of me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Here's your research - they love to screw us Californians on gas prices, the end!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Which end?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I suppose this is the Golden State of Screwing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hey, we didn't have it much easier in Washington so knock it off with the territorial whining</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> What I want to know is what Ona Rosa Sanchez has that makes men like KJ and Captain Phelps so crazy for her - I mean she's very pretty and sweet but Anita is much better looking... if she wasn't so butch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Kage and Crunch have the mommy thing going, they see Oni cooking and taking care of the kids... they want to be breast fed too, if you know what I mean</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Aw man, can we just go back to playing cards, please?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Also, there's the challenge of stealing another man's candy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Ugh, I'd rather be listening to Barry Manilow right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> So, does this mean you're after Dr. Sanchez's &quot;Skittles&quot; as well, Zachary?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> EWW, GOD NO - I am NOT attracted to Oni because she IS a wife and mom!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Amy, where's the Extra Strength Tylenol?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I have a crystal that will help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Is it big enough to bash with?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You have me fascinated, Zach, go on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> She is another man's trophy - he's hunted her, shot her and bagged her - she's now an empty shell after giving birth, her individual life is over, her main purpose now is to service her husband and to make sure the children don't starve</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan and Gracie look at him aghast as Amy tries not to laugh.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> It's true - a man has basted his seed in her oven and she's popped out his turkey - why would you want that used oven when there are brand new ones just waiting to be plucked off of the showroom floor... on sale, no less?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You have two seconds to leave this table 
 before I slice off your turkey baster</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> HEY - you can't get mad at me for telling the truth, especially under the &quot;Beer Honesty&quot; rule</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Beer Honesty?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> After three beers, our PC editor shuts off and we say how we really feel without fearing repercussions</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Huh - the sad thing is, I kind of see Zach's POV, I don't condone or justify it but I understand the twisted rationale</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You see every point of view, Morri, pick a side and stick with it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Looking at the TV screen) Shh, be quiet, I want to hear this story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It's my night off, I do not want to hear news</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Would you rather hear more of Zach's musings?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Turn it up, girl!</p>

<div class="stage">There is a short segment about new crop circles in England. It has Amy's complete attention while Zach and Gracie roll their eyes. Morrigan watches in silence.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Near tears) Beautiful

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/v03_amys_tv.jpg" h="349" w="349"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">Zach lets out a loud belch as Gracie hums the theme to Sigma 7.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Go ahead and laugh, you'll see
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> C'mon, Amy, it's a bunch of blokes who've had one too many at the pub and they're looking to express their creativity - they probably work for the tourist commission to boot</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Have you seen how elaborate the designs are? - you can't even piss straight when you're drunk, Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I can write my name in the snow just fine, thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Oh yeah? - try cleaning your toilet after the next party</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I thought tonight was supposed to be about fun and relaxation... SILLY SILLY ME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Gracie, your profession is based on images, what do you think?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I think blue cheese is intriguing but I don't question it nor do I care to, there are more important things to consider like how in the hell am I going to pay my insurance deductible, things like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> What do you think, M&amp;M?</p>

<div class="stage">Still staring at the TV screen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh... I'm sorry - what did you say?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Great, now she's flying off to whacko land</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Studying Morrigan) What do you think of the crop circles?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I believe they're the result of an intricate weather phenomenon we haven't figured out yet - just think about snowflakes, before the invention of the microscope, we had no idea how complex and beautiful they were</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone is silent for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Whether these circles are natural or man-made, they're definitely worth trying to solve
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Yet ANOTHER mystery for KCON's fearless field reporter!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Still watching Morrigan) What if they're not natural or man-made?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, WOULD YOU ALL JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND DEAL THE GOD DAMN CARDS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Suddenly getting up) I need to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I guess Ginger Ale shoots through quicker than beer</p>

<div class="stage">McBride starts to put on her jacket.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Wait a minute, where are you going?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Out for a walk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Alone in the dark?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll be fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yes, we're all aware of how uneventful your life is</p>

<div class="stage">Closing the door behind her, the brunette does not respond.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> She's been acting weird since her date with KJ
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> More weird than usual?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Maybe I should have a little talk with Kage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Will you be using your trophy deer analogy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Hmm... depends</p>
