  <h1>Vignette 5</h1><h2>Soothing</h2>

<div class="stage">As early afternoon settles over the Quartz Lake Inn, Joe Tiszo, the owner and master chef of the establishment, tends to the vineyards just south of the property. He gazes towards the lake and notices a small, private plane flying low, curving behind the mountains and disappearing from view.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Glancing at his watch) As usual</p>

<div class="stage">He suddenly grabs his head in anguish and spins around.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> AAAAHH - I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU ANYMORE - GO BACK, BACK I SAY</p>

<div class="stage">The old man drops his tools and takes off running towards the Inn. Playing a few tunes inside the deserted piano bar is Erika von Meer. Joe arrives moments later and quietly observes her from the other end of the room. He now ambles over to the statuesque blonde as she finishes playing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Slumping on top of the black baby grand) Ow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Softly applauding) Brava, Vihar</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking up) Joe... I didn't hear you come in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> It is hard to listen a million miles away - I recognize Monteverdi's &quot;Vespo della Beata Vergine&quot; but I am unaware of the last piece</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> &quot;The Stone&quot;</p>

<div class="stage">Joe looks at her quizzically.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Dave Matthews Band</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Ah, very pretty - tell me, are you feeling any better?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Plinking a D flat note with her pinky) Not really - the headache still persists</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Did you take something for it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Half smile) It is beyond the power of ibuprofen, I'm afraid</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Then, I have just the thing... COME</p>

<div class="stage">The old man motions for her to follow him and she reluctantly does. Erika takes a seat at a lone table in the corner of the Inn's kitchen as Joe brings her a steaming bowl of soup and a few garlic rolls.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> This will drive the nastiness out of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Picking at the garlic roll) Not to mention drive away everything else</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Enough talking... EAT</p>

<div class="stage">Erika sighs, stirs the bowl a few times and takes in a spoonful of the broth.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Coughing) That's pretty powerful chicken soup!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> You can thank my special paprika and mushrooms!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Raising an eyebrow) We'll see... I do appreciate you letting me stay here, the motion on my boat was not helping</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Not a problem - but I am curious as to why you did not choose to stay at your family's house?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Now eating heartily) I needed some peace and quite</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Surely you could have found it in on one of the three floors?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Heh, you don't know my family</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Bringing her a glass of iced tea) I think I know them better than you do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Covering her ears) Not now, Joe, please not now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Very well... finish your soup</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I shall - I have a scenario for you...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Chess, fencing, or something else?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Maybe all three</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Go ahead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Hypothetically, I am about to bring over a reluctant ally to my side but this ally is also a key player to the entire game, yet she does not realize it - by bringing her to my side, I am able to better protect her but then I leave myself more vulnerable and thus her as well... is this a wise move?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Pondering) No... but it is an essential one - correct?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'll find out, one way or the other</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Watching her) You won't be in a position to find anything out as long as you continue to feel this way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Finishing her soup) You're right - I think I need to lie down now</p>

<div class="stage">The von Meer daughter slowly gets up and heads for her room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> If I don't wake up myself, please pound on my door before this evening - I have a faculty meeting at the university... and thanks for the soup</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> My pleasure, Vihar - get some rest!</p>

<div class="stage">The old man watches her leave and then goes over to a phone on the wall. He dials it and then speaks in a foreign language.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> She is here and she is not well</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Inside one of the well-appointed suites of the Quartz Lake Inn, Erika takes off her glasses, strips down to her underwear, and lies with a cloth full of ice on her forehead. She quickly nods off and starts to dream. Flashing back to six years ago, the blonde now sees herself arriving at the Indian Ocean Marine Institute with a couple of colleagues in Colombo, Sri Lanka.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> Would you look at this place? - my dorm building is bigger than all of it combined!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Lugging an olive duffle bag) Just remember, we're here for one semester and then we get the hell home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> I'm counting the days</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Shaking her head) I could've had Australia or New Zealand but NOOO - my asshole adviser sticks me out here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> Probably because you didn't give him a blow job</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You gave him one and it didn't help you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> SLAM DUNK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> (Taking a seat on a stone bench in the courtyard) He probably resents you for being rich and beautiful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I resent me for being rich and beautiful but you can't argue with my grades... in fact, that's really the reason I'm here - apparently, one of the IOMI staff members was impressed with my thesis and specifically asked for me on this assignment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> (Making kissing noises) Oooh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> I'm guessing he saw your picture in the department roster and thought &quot;YAH, I GET ME SOME OF THAT, YAH YAH&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> NAH NAH, aint gonna happen - if he's lucky, I might let him carry my scuba gear</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> SO GENEROUS OF YOU, RIK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> Not to mention, Griffin won't be too thrilled with this guy's &quot;special request&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Rif is in Europe, not much he can do about it either way - I, on the other hand...</p>

<div class="stage">The blonde pulls a large diving knife out of her pack and wiggles the blade.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> (Reading a guide book) Hey, do you two remember the difference between the Sinhalese and the Tamils?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> No, and quite frankly I could care less - I just want to know where the discos and the bars are!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> (High-fiving her) AMEN, SISTER</p>

<div class="stage">A man clearing his throat startles the trio. They turn around to find an older man of small stature but with overly large, round glasses staring down at them from the top step of one of the building's entrances.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Da Silva</span> There will be no drinking tonight for we will be diving the Maldives first thing tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> Oh, right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> Sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Checking the name on her notes) Are you Dr. Ranasinghe?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Da Silva</span> No, I am Dr. Arjuna Da Silva and I assume you three to be the American students from Scripps?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Correct</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Da Silva</span> Excellent, please follow me - I'll show you where to get settled... which one of you is Ms. von Meer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Waving her hand once) That would be me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Da Silva</span> If you don't mind, Sam is very anxious to meet you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> (Slapping Erika on the rear) I bet he is</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> (Aside) Get that knife ready</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Da Silva</span> Please proceed to the blue building in the corner - don't worry, we'll take care of your belongings</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Hesitant) Alright...</p>

<div class="stage">She turns to her colleagues and pinches their ears.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> If I find out either one of you dipped into my stash while I'm gone, you're going to get smacked something nasty!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #1</span> I'm counting on it!</p>

<div class="stage">The older man scowls through his glasses.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Colleague #2</span> I apologize, Dr. Da Silva, we're a little giddy from our flight, we'll be more professional tomorrow, promise!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Laughing and heading off towards the blue building) SPEAK FOR YOURSELF</p>

<div class="stage">Skipping inside the main hall of the building, Erika checks out the empty labs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> OH SAM, SAMMY, SAMBO, SAMSONITE, SAM-I-AM - WHERE ARE YOU? - YOUR NEW STUDENT HAS COME TO LEARN</p>

<div class="stage">A lack of response causes Erika to walk towards the only room with a light on at the end of the hall. Upon entering, she finds a private office filled with books, files, and several dramatically lit fish tanks containing odd rock formations among the creatures.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking around) Hmm</p>

<div class="stage">She spots a plate of fruit on the desk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> MMM, I'm starving</p>

<div class="stage">Looking over her shoulder and then back to the plate, she quickly snatches a papaya and bites into it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> You should try the Rambutan, it is much sweeter</p>

<div class="stage">Erika is startled at the sight before her in the doorway. A woman, only slightly older with long, dark hair and equally dark eyes, smiles and points to the plate.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> The one with the red hairy skin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Uh... I think I'll stick with the papaya</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Taking the Rambutan and peeling it) You don't know what you're missing, Ms. von Meer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You're Sam? - sorry, I mean Dr. Ranasinghe?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Extending her hand) Samadara Ranasinghe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Shaking it) Of course, it is a pleasure to meet you</p>

<div class="stage">Enjoying her piece of the Rambutan, Sam now gently offers the rest of it to her hesitant pupil. Erika finally gives in and is shocked by the delicious flavor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Laughing) Indeed, the pleasure is all mine</p>

<div class="stage">The tall blonde notices the beautiful shell bracelet on the right wrist of the mocha-skinned woman.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That's gorgeous</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Thank you, it's a family heirloom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Damn, I was hoping they had them in a little shop around here - my mother's birthday is coming up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Taking a seat behind her desk with an amused expression) We have plenty of other interesting things around here, I can assure you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Also taking a seat) Great</p>

<div class="stage">Sam is silent for a brief moment as she regards an increasingly nervous Erika.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Um, I understand you specifically asked for me... why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Eating another piece of fruit) I was impressed with your work</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> So I've been told - but you must also be aware that my main area of focus is transgenic ichthyology... yours is marine geology and metallurgy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> It never hurts to broaden your scope</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Raising an eyebrow) If you say so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> (Now rising) I do... please follow me, I'll give you a quick tour of the facilities you'll be working in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Won't I be working with the others?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Occasionally... but most of your time will be spent with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Oh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Sam</span> Do you foresee a problem with that?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika thinks for a moment as she gently brushes past Dr. Ranasinghe on her way out of the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Not yet</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Just off the Quartz Lake Inn's tennis courts, Pauline von Meer relaxes on the patio with a glass of orange juice. Joe Tiszo makes his way over to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Joe, darling - would it be too much to ask for a slice of your wonderful poppyseed cake?</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/v05_joe_and_pauline.jpg" width="520" height="287" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Taking a seat next to her) It's cooling as we speak, I'll bring you a fresh slice in a few minutes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Brushing her face with her towel) Wonderful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> I see you were giving lessons to Ben &amp; Claudia's children?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Yes, the oldest one has the raw talent but is much too lazy - the younger one will most likely make the juniors, the ambition is definitely there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> So young to be so driven</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> It's a good thing - I wish my own children were that driven to succeed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> You have a son that's a lawyer and a daughter with a PhD. - that's pretty successful in my book</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Patting Joe on the back) Well, that's your book, Padre</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Speaking of your daughter... she's here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> You mean she's not at the lab? - will wonders ever cease!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> I think you should go to her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Why, so she can pretend I don't exist?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> You're being too hard on her, Pauline - she knows you exist... everyone knows you exist</p>

<div class="stage">The two share a quick chuckle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Unfortunately, Joe, she's always off in her own world and she has made it abundantly clear that I am not a part of it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Try being a part of it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Sorry, the only fish I want to know about are broiled in a light dill sauce</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> No one is talking about fish - just LISTEN to her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Fake shock) She speaks more than one phrase at a time?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> She does with me and she will for you... if you give her a chance - think of it as a match, bring your opponent into the net more often</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Kissing his bald head) Well, since you put it that way and because you're an adorable man who makes the best poppyseed cake, I shall</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> (Holding his hand over his heart) You are a true champion, on and off the court!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> And don't forget to mention stunningly attractive... so, where is my firstborn, playing chess or hiding in the piano bar?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joe</span> Erika is lying down in a suite... she's not feeling very well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Jumping up) Take me to her!</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Now tossing and turning violently on her bed, Erika continues to dream as her mother enters the room alone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Perspiring) Sam... no... NO - HELP ME - SAM, SAAAAAAM</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/v05_pauline_door.jpg" width="363" height="466" border="0"></p>


<div class="stage">Mrs. von Meer approaches her daughter's bedside as Erika wakes up with a start.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Honey, relax... it was just a nightmare</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Dazed) Mother?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Yes, Sweetie, I'm right here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What are you doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Joe told me where to find you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Did he now?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika sighs and slumps down on the bed.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Rubbing her daughter's forehead) He's worried about you and so am I</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> There's no need to worry, I'm fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Maybe we should have Stephanie take a look at you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Really, mother, I'm fine... I just have a little cold</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Covering her daughter up with her jacket) Who wouldn't sleeping in this freezing room half dressed - come on, we're going back to the house</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I can't... I have a faculty meeting tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Gathering Erika's things) Tough, cancel it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> But...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> No &quot;buts&quot; - you are coming home and resting with your family where you belong</p>

<div class="stage">Erika tries to sit up but the headache is still overpowering.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Helping her daughter get dressed) No arguments, Erika</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Fine, I'm too weak to argue with you anyway</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> And, once you're feeling better, we're getting you out of your hiding holes and back to socializing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Pulling on her clothes) Please, I already have a headache</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> You haven't been out since the Museum Ball</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Putting on her glasses) And we all know how well that went</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> We'll start off slow - your father ran into your brother's new dalliance on the beach the other night...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Morrigan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Whatever her name is - he wants to have a family dinner at the house and insists on inviting her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I suppose I could handle that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Helping fix Erika's hair) Good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Mom... could you rub my neck?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Doing so) Good Lord, are you tense! - I'm going to get the name of Ursula's new chiropractor for you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I don't need a chiropractor, I just need...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Pausing) What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking down) I don't know</p>

<div class="stage">Now wrapping her arms around Erika's shoulders, Pauline brings her daughter back against her into a hug. The two share a warm, silent embrace for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Rikki... are you ever going to tell me about Sam?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Breaking away and heading for the door) I'll meet you at the car... I need to thank Joe for the soup</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Sighing) Yeah... thanks, Joe</p>
