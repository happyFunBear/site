<div class="stage">Upon seeing Darkfin standing directly in front of her, a speechless Morrigan McBride drops her flashlight and slowly starts
    to back away, into the cave.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It would be wise of you to look forward if you choose to venture inside</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying to catch her breath) It's... it's true - this is not a dream... or a nightmare</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Looking back into the cave) That has yet to be decided</p>

<div class="stage">The taller form picks up the flashlight and approaches the smaller woman.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Handing her the light) Take this, you will need it</p>

<div class="stage">As Morrigan reluctantly grasps the handle, she focuses on the hand, the hand from her visions, and recoils at its cold touch.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Fumbling with the flashlight) The... the only other time I have ever touched a hand this cold...</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> My body temperature is not the same as yours</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Her mind reeling) Of course, you're... um, you're a fish... or something</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Still glaring) Or something</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You... uh, you speak English very well</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Would you prefer me to speak in another language?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh no, English is just fine... heh, I was kind of expecting Flipper noises</p>

<div class="stage">There is a long silence.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can you talk to dolphins?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Brushing past her) I do not have time for this, Ms. McBride</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How do you know my name? - in fact, how do you know ME? - why are we connected?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Sensing danger) I suggest that you leave... NOW</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Listen, part of me totally agrees with you... but the other part - the part that controls my legs -
    is telling me to find out what's in this cave</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Going further inside) I do not think you are ready for what is in this cave... I am not sure I am ready
    for what is in this cave</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Following her) What's in this cave?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I am not certain</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ooh, the &quot;I'm not certain&quot; chimaera - that's almost as scary as... you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Stopping and glowering back at her) Trust me - if I am not certain of what lies ahead, you should be
    deeply afraid</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Well, &quot;I'm not certain&quot; can also turn out to be positive... like when you bite into an ice-cream
    and, to your pleasant surprise, there's a hidden ripple of caramel buried inside</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, a swift, cold draft blows past them, followed by an increasing roar.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Perhaps that is your caramel ripple now</p>

<div class="stage">The two brace themselves against the cave wall and crouch behind a small rock formation. Morrigan tries to shine the dying
    flashlight in the direction of the rumbling.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't understand, I put new batteries in here last week - it shouldn't be fading on me so fast!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It is being drained... you cannot stop it</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why does this keep happening? - explain it to me</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Scoping out all of the surroundings) Not now</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You were the one who just told me I would need it</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c01_mm_scared.jpg" h="440" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> To use as a weapon</p>

<div class="stage">As they draw closer, the rumbling is now more distinct. Glowing torches now line the cave walls.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is that... is that singing?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (All of her fins in full spread) Chanting... YOU MUST GO BACK</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Then, I wish you luck</p>

<div class="stage">With a quick flip, Darkfin vaults away and then twists up to the ceiling and sticks there out of Morrigan's sight.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> HEY, WAIT A MINUTE - COME BACK HERE - WHERE DID YOU GO?</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, three cloaked figures appear before her, two in brown, one in blue.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Blue figure</span> We are right here, Child - and we have been awaiting your arrival</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan tries to back away slowly with a smile.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hey, you know what, how about another time? - see, I forgot to bring my robe... feel free to call me
    at KCON for an interview!</p>

<div class="stage">With one swift move, the two in the brown robes are on either side of her.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Now, I don't want to seem rude but I really need to GO</p>

<div class="stage">She kicks one in the shin and takes off running. The second brown-robed figure lunges for her when Darkfin drops from above
    and breaks its back. She then slams the first one's head hard against the rock wall. Before Morrigan has a chance to
    escape, the one in blue stands before the passageway out of the cave.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Blue figure</span> We are not finished</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (About to slash it with her arm fin) If you value your carotid, you will step aside</p>

<div class="stage">The figure chuckles and, with a quick wave of the hand, hurls Darkfin across the room without actually touching her. Aleta
    Oscura quickly rebounds and heads straight for the figure again.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Blue figure</span> (Dodging Darkfin's attack) Your trident is not at your side?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Twisting into the air) I only bring a weapon my opponent cannot control</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Blue figure</span> And what did you bring with you tonight?</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, Morrigan slams the flashlight against the side of the blue figure's head.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> BACKUP</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin now takes the stunned figure, shoves it out of the way and pulls Morrigan towards the cave's exit.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WAIT - let's see who this is!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> RRRUUUNNN</p>

<div class="stage">Before either of them can react, Morrigan's leg buckles under her and she is being mysteriously dragged across the cave floor
    towards the figure in blue. Darkfin grabs under her arms and tries with all of her might to hold on. The figure in blue
    crawls up to the screaming reporter and rips the shoe off of her left foot. Morrigan passes out and falls limp. Darkfin
    suddenly takes notice of a tall figure in a white robe with coral-colored fingernails approaching from one of the caverns.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">White figure</span> (To Darkfin) Come here... by my side</p>

<div class="stage">The sea creature bears her teeth in defiance.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">White figure</span> It is for your benefit</p>

<div class="stage">Suspicious yet curious about her powerful rival, Darkfin does as asked. The two now stand near each other.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">White figure</span> (Facing the fallen Morrigan) Present her mark to me</p>

<div class="stage">Clutching the woman's ankle, the blue figure holds the foot up to expose a distinct triskele image on the sole.</div>


<div class="stage">Darkfin is stunned at the sight of this as it begins to glow in the same manner as her trident.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c01_morrigans_foot.jpg" h="323" w="570"  b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">White figure</span> ENOUGH - LET THEM PASS</p>

<div class="stage">With that, both cloaked figures disappear into the mist, leaving Darkfin to gather up an unconscious Morrigan. She quickly
    carries her out of the cave, into a fiercely stormy night, and heads towards the reporter's car. After carefully settling
    the petite woman into the passenger's seat, Aleta Oscura jumps into the driver's seat, finds the key and starts up the
    engine.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c01_df_carries_mm.jpg" h="456" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Wonderful, a stick-shift... and I am left-hand dominant</p>

<div class="stage">Awkwardly navigating the white Mustang down the windy roads of the Kiyomis, Darkfin tries to recall in her mind the chanting
    she heard and what it meant.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Was that Patristic Latin? - this does not make any sense</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Fading in and out) And you do?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Touching her forehead) How do you feel?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Like I'm swimming in sand... my foot is burning but the rest of me is freezing</p>

<div class="stage">The driver reluctantly turns on the heat and aims all of the vents at the passenger.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Tell me how you got that tattoo</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Only if you tell me how you became a fish</p>

<div class="stage">The car makes a grinding noise.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You need to shift gears</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Right</p>

<div class="stage">The car is now speeding along on the main highway as it heads back into the city. The rain continues to pelt down, prompting
    Darkfin to open her driver's side window just enough to splash some of the drops on her face.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still groggy but watching) You can turn off the heat if it's bothering you... you literally are a fish
    out of water</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Focusing on the road) Be silent and rest</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why do you kill?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Why do you breathe?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Never answer a question with a question</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Close your mouth before I kill you</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You won't kill me - you keep saving me... why?</p>

<div class="stage">The passenger feels herself drifting off again and does not hear the answer.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">The sound of three howling cats awakens Morrigan. She realizes that she is still in her car, now parked in Amy's driveway,
    and it is early morning.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Quickly sitting up and rubbing her head) I'm home - how did she know...</p>

<div class="stage">Wearing black and white cow pattern pajamas, Amethyst Hill grabs one of her cats off of the car and peers in the window at
    her tenant.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> WILD NIGHT, EH?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sighing) You could say that</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Too much liquorage?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not nearly enough</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Watching Tyson sniff the steering wheel) My babies are going crazy - why does it slightly reek of yesterday's
    catch in here?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Stretching) I went fishing</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I thought you were going hiking?</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Running, spelunking... more running</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Well, that must have been some little hike with KJ because you look absolutely thrashed... in a good
    way</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> KJ? - oh, right</p>

<div class="stage">The KCON reporter slowly stumbles out of the Mustang and tries to walk with one shoe.</div>

<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Wow, that's some limp - I want the juicy details!</p>
<p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking back at her car) So do I</p>
