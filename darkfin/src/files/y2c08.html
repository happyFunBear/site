<div class="stage">At a USCG base south of Chaparral Heights, Captain Phelps and Lieutenant Fiore board their helicopter and take off into the night sky. Craig sighs and studies some charts as Anita hovers at the appropriate altitude over the Pacific Ocean.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Anita...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> NO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You don't even know what I was going to say?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Whenever you start a sentence with my first name in that annoying tight-ass tone of yours, it's never good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Look, my commanding officer is starting to come down on me about these after-hour trips in the bird - I don't know how much longer I can spin it without him getting suspicious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'll get Sandy to say we're helping SCU with research - in a way, we are</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> The cost of fuel for this guzzler is starting to outweigh &quot;good relations&quot; with the university - &quot;hunting for Darkfin&quot; is not going to cut it, we need something solid to show him or he's going to cut off our access altogether!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> It won't be much longer, I can FEEL it - these bizarre concussive waves that we've been picking up on the instruments are more than some random anomaly - Sandy says they're being emitted by some kind of sea creature, he's just not sure what it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> And he's absolutely ruled out a horny dolphin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Scowling at him) Yeah, I'm pretty sure he has!</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c08_anita_cockpit.jpg" h="392" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> OK then, let's start in where we left off last time - head for sector six</p>

<div class="stage">The chiseled woman does a sharp turn and smirks as the equally-chiseled man clutches his seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> HEY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Winking) There's no reason we can't have a little fun while we're up here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Speaking of fun, have you found a new playmate or are you still obsessing over that actress chick?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Who says I can't do both?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Ah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> There's just something about Jamie, I've been crushed out on her since I was a kid - I even bought &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; for her, man!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I thought her name was Marcy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Oh yeah, that's her real name, but she'll always be &quot;Jamie&quot; to 99.99% of North America and overseas syndicated markets</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That's kind of sad when you think about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Raising an eyebrow) Hmm, my mind is elsewhere</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Surprise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> What about you, Cap, did any of those yacht bimbos come through for you... pun intended?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Ahehe... um - you could say that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Slapping him a high five) ALRIGHT, SCORE BABY - which one? - the short blonde with fake boobs?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Nope</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> The dyed redhead with fake teeth?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Try again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> The white girl pretending to be black?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Strike three!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> C'MON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'll give you a hint, she has an accent</p>

<div class="stage">Anita runs through the women in her mind and then suddenly slaps Craig on the arm with a map.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Oh God, you mean Ursula, aka MRS. MARTEL?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> BINGO</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> That's just disgusting, Phelps!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> WHY? - she showed up at my place the other night with a bottle of champagne and wearing absolutely nothing under her fur coat... LIKE YOU'D EVER TURN THAT DOWN</p>

<div class="stage">Lieutenant Fiore looks sheepish.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Noticing) Uh-huh, that's what I thought</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> BUT... SHE'S... MARRIED - Jesus, what is up with you and other men's wives? - first, it's my sister, now it's Martel's Yugo-trophy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> She came to ME, remember?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Still, there are plenty of single girls out there, try to find ONE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You mean, you've actually left some for me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Patting his shoulder) You're not just my captain, you're also my friend</p>

<div class="stage">The two chuckle and look out the window to the water below.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Sector six, dead ahead!</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Just past the breakwater off the shore near Beacon Point, Darkfin gives Morrigan some last minute instructions before they swim out to sea.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Right arm wrapped around Morrigan's upper body) Because I will have to support your weight along with my own, I will not be traveling at my normal speed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm still not quite sure how this is going to work - I mean, I DO know how to swim</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Yes, but you could never keep up with me, therefore, I need you to relax and follow my rhythm</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan rolls her eyes as she clutches the waist of Aleta Oscura.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Do you know what a sine wave looks like?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you speaking math to me? - DON'T</p>

<div class="stage">The two stare at each other for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Blinking) Let me use another example... do you like Ribbon Candy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Eyes lighting up) OH MY GOD, I LOVE RIBBON CANDY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I have no Ribbon Candy for you - now that you have the appropriate mental image, I want you to envision us following that pattern when we swim</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why didn't you just say &quot;up and down?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Because, technically, it is not up and down - we will be arcing in precise intervals - intervals that are ten seconds apart, so you need to time your inhalation of air to exactly when we surface</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Basically, we're playing &quot;Dolphin&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That is another appropriate example - are you ready?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not saying this is going to happen or anything but what if, um, I lose my timing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Do not worry, I will know if you are in distress</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OK then, take me to your Fortress of Solitude!</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c08_df_mm_swimming.jpg" h="425" w="600"  b="0"></p>


<div class="stage">And with that, they are off under the water. Morrigan is amazed at how quickly Darkfin can swim, even while carrying her along side. Feeling like she is on an amusement park ride, the smaller woman is able to adapt to the motion quickly and is proud of herself for not messing up the breathing times. About ten minutes go by before they reach the island of Concha Dos and descend into a sea cave. Once they surface on the other side, Darkfin helps Morrigan step out of the water and into her secret laboratory.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Gasping a bit) That was fun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> For you</p>

<div class="stage">The curious KCON reporter strolls around the entire area, taking in the sights of the rock walls and sand floors that contain a fully-functional lab with a refrigerator, x-ray machine, and a hyperbaric chamber.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Watching her) Looking for something?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Huh? - sorry, just searching for animatronic pirates</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Going over to her computer) We need to begin the tests</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I suppose you don't have any potato chips around here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Only squid in the livewell</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Arms folded) It's not quite the same without pesto sauce... and deep frying - so, what shall I call you - Aleta Oscura... Fish Stick... Finny Fin Fin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> The Anglo consensus seems to be &quot;Darkfin&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> But what do the Danes and Jutes prefer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Preparing several syringes) What is behind the wall of sarcasm?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No one has ever scaled it before - SCALED, ha</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin simply looks at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Well, if someone does succeed in scaling the wall, then they have to cross the Moat of Suspicious Animosity and conquer the Castle of Quiet Despair</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That does not sound so difficult</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Be on the lookout for trolls</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Please come here and sit down</p>

<div class="stage">Against her better judgment, Morrigan takes a seat and allows Darkfin to draw a blood sample. She is also subjected to several other physical tests.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Eying the expensive lab equipment) I would like to know how you got all of this stuff here... did the mothership beam it down?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Checking the woman's body temperature) I have my ways</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan peers at the many test tubes and beakers before her. She pokes at a partially dissected sea cucumber with her finger</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Looking in a microscope) Please do not touch anything</p>

<div class="stage">A defiant Morrigan leans over and licks an empty glass jar.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> That jar used to contain turtle urine</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan blanches with a slight gag.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Jotting down some notes) You can try</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why don't you have gills?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> My lungs can adapt to an aqueous medium for breathing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sort of like a baby in a womb?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Not quite</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Does this mean you're natural or man-made?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I prefer the term &quot;enhanced&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Scoffing) Oh, brother!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I need you to unzip your suit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Nervous) Umm, why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I would like to listen to your heart</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Acquiescent) Fine</p>

<div class="stage">As she does, Darkfin notices a tiny scar along the top of Morrigan's right breast.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Absently tracing it with her finger) How did you get this?</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c08_mad_mm.jpg" h="580" w="420"  b="0" a="center"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Slapping her hand away) I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS FOR ONE DAY - TAKE ME HOME</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan strides towards the tidal pool.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I deeply apologize for any perceived inappropriateness, I just need to know as much as I can</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You know FAR more than I do - how do you know I won't come back here with a fleet of Navy ships?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You have yet to return to the Kiyomi caves with a battalion of Army tanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pacing) You know, you think you're some kind of key source for me - sorry, you're nothing but a key source of insanity... and a killer no less!</p>

<div class="stage">A quiet Darkfin remains at a distance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> If I gave you up, this would be the story to put me behind Tom Brokaw's anchor desk, yet, I come here and let you draw blood from me - how do I even know you're drawing blood? - maybe you're implanting me with your anchovy fish babies</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin unsuccessfully tries to stifle a grin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Wow, you just smiled - there IS some human in you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Not that much</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Enough to be a 36C cup</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Going over to her side) Jealous?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Blame your mother's gene for that - but be grateful that she passed on something better to you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What are you talking about?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin glances down at Morrigan's left foot and then walks over to a shelf. She pulls out the chest containing the ancient book and shell bracelet. An intrigued McBride follows and observes the reverent way in which Darkfin handles the shells.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's a beautiful bracelet - may I?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Quickly stashing it away) NO... that is not what I have come to show you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Where did you get this book?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Flipping through the pages) It was passed on to me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying to recognize the writing) Is that Sanskrit?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> A form of it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How old is this book?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Older than Duquesa Bay</p>

<div class="stage">Aleta Oscura finds the appropriate page and shows it to her guest.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Instantly recognizing the symbol) That's the mark on the bottom of my foot! - I don't understand?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Suddenly closing the book) You will... each piece of the puzzle at a time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> NO, DAMMIT, YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW - I AM SICK AND TIRED OF ALL THIS MYSTERY SHIT - I'VE HAD IT WITH FISH WOMEN AND WEIRDOS IN BATHROBES... SAY SOMETHING</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Nereidium</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excuse me?</p>

<div class="stage">With a quick motion, Darkfin summons the trident out of the tidal pool and into her hand.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c08_df_tridect.jpg" h="406" w="620"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I was wondering what happened to your pretty swizzle stick</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Nereidium is what this is made of - it is what the clasp of the Duquesa's Tears is made of... it is the metal of your mark, the metal in your blood</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying to think) Wait a minute, wait a minute... WHAT?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin suddenly loses her balance and catches herself.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Noticing) Are you alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Rubbing her head) You have learned enough for tonight, I must take you back</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll go, but I need something from you, first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You are in no position to make demands of me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Going up to Darkfin and pointing her finger into her chest) I think I am - it's time for YOU to start helping ME when I ask for it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Eyes blazing) Do not poke me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You're lucky I don't cover you in tarter sauce and call you dinner!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Stepping towards her) Care to swim home alone?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Stepping back) I could</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Good luck with the sharks</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is suddenly silent.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Softening her tone) What exactly do you need my help with?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Research on a story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> And what do I have to do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Help me break into an office</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> You cannot do this alone?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) It would be a lot easier with your help - you can scale walls, I know it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Which office?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Meeramar Shipping - specifically, Griffin Martel of the PCOC</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span>  (Thinking for a moment) When?</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll send you an IM</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin silently nods and then takes Morrigan by the hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Time to go</p>

<div class="stage">Now half way to the shore, Darkfin suddenly picks up on the distress call of several dolphins. She stops where she is and swims Morrigan over to a nearby marker buoy.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What's going on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Sensing a fishing boat a few miles away) Someone has decided to use illegal tuna nets again - three dolphins are tangled... I will be back for you shortly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WAIT</p>

<div class="stage">Aleta Oscura pauses.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Set the dolphins free but don't kill the fishermen - a slight maiming, maybe, but please no murdering tonight!</p>

<div class="stage">Without an answer, Darkfin turns and sets off in the direction of the boat. Morrigan holds on tight to the buoy and strains to hear a growing rumbling. Moments later, Craig and Anita's helicopter approaches from the north.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking up) THAT'S JUST GREAT</p>

<div class="stage">The helicopter draws closer with its searchlight.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c08_chopper.jpg" h="220" w="420"  b="0" a="center"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'm getting tired, Fiore, let's pack it in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'll turn around at the marker buoy and we'll call it a night</p>

<div class="stage">Looking through her IR goggles, Anita catches something out of the corner of her eye.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Throwing off her goggles) Aim the light on the buoy and hand me the binos, quick!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Doing so) What do you see?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking) I'm not sure, I need to get closer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> It's probably just a seal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> AY, DE MI</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is smiling and waving to the helicopter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> IT'S MCBRIDE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Grabbing the binoculars) WHAT? - IS SHE INSANE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> SHE KNOWS SOMETHING, SHE KNOWS SOMETHING</p>

<div class="stage">The helicopter hovers low to the water and drops over a ladder. Craig's voice comes on the loud speaker.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> MS. MCBRIDE, PLEASE CLIMB UP... NOW</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan slowly does and flops into a seat in back of the two Coast Guard officers.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Handing her a blanket) What on earth are you doing out here this late? - do you know how cold the water is?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Staring at her unzipped wetsuit) I think it's pretty obvious she knows how cold it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Glaring at Anita) I'm on an impromptu scuba dive</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Where's your tank? - how come you only have a bra and panties on under the wetsuit instead of a regular bikini?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Zipping her suit up) How kind of you to notice... I said it was impromptu - besides, I'm in International Waters, I can do whatever I want!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> WRONG - IW is another 10 miles out and you're sitting on USCG property</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Fine, if you're going to arrest me, you need to arrest the dozens of sea lions that also sit on your precious property</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Tell us what you're doing out here and we'll let you go</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan tries to think of something as she stalls for time for Darkfin. However, before she can respond, a mayday call comes in over the radio. It's from the fishing boat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Snarling back at Morrigan) SHE'S OUT HERE, ISN'T SHE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Casually looking at one of their maps) I have no idea who you're talking about, lieutenant</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Snatching the map out of Morrigan's hand) I should push you out that door right now and use you as bait!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting up) That's fine by me, I have better things to do than sit here with you two!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Stopping her) HOLD IT, HOLD IT, EVERYONE JUST STAY SEATED AND CALM DOWN... Anita, head for the ship - Ms. McBride, I highly suggest you explain to me what you are doing out here or I could get you in a lot of trouble you don't need</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And I could get you in a lot of bad publicity YOU don't need - I'm researching a story on illegal night fishing and how the Coast Guard is seriously LAGGING on the job</p>

<div class="stage">Anita begins to curse in Spanish but Craig whispers something into her ear. Moments later, the helicopter hovers over the ship, flooding it with its searchlight. Three battered crewmen are strung up in the fishing net while another one, badly bruised but alive, signals to Captain Phelps. There is no sign of Darkfin.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c08_anita_star.jpg" h="191" w="191"  b="0" a="center"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Letting out a sigh of relief) Satisfied now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Shaking her finger back at Morrigan) NUNCA... NEVER</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, Morrigan takes notice of Anita's metal bracelet and grabs her wrist.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?</p>

<div class="stage">The lieutenant is caught off guard and quietly pulls her hand away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> It's a family heirloom... why?</p>
