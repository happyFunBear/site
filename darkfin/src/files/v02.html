<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Glancing at her watch) I do hope Ona Rosa shows up soon, I am absolutely starving!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Sipping her iced tea) I know what you mean, I am about to reach over to the next table and snatch us a couple of jumbo prawns</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Please do - this new medicine the doctors have me on is making me eat like a pig... so, not only do I get to be a cripple, I get to be a fat cripple</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Waving her finger) Woman, do not talk about yourself that way in front of my eyes, for my eyes only see a beautiful, intelligent, caring, soul!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Patting her hand) Thank you, Shel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> So, is the medicine helping at all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> It's helping put my grocer's children through college</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Covering her ears) Children and college - I do not want to hear those words together!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Little Calvin has a few years to go yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Yes, however, by the time he is ready - it will cost me more than what my house is worth... I make a good living and I manage my money well but I am still looking at an exorbitant amount</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> With you being a professor at the university, that will undoubtedly help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Aghast) Did you just fall out of a coconut tree? - my son is NOT going to Santa Conchita University - only Harvard or Oxford... Yale if all else fails</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Sipping her wine) No pressure on Cal</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I want what's best for him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I'd consider it a personal victory if Penny made it into SCU - hell, she'll be lucky to get into a community college</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Ah, but Penny is a very bright girl, she just needs to apply herself more</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Sighing) According to one of the lifeguards, she was applying herself to Brad behind some sand dunes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> GOODNESS, that man is her uncle!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> I know, but he keeps throwing the adoption factor in my face - it's bad enough she dates that Jeremy boy but now Brad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Shaking her head) I pray to Oshzn she protects herself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Thank God the lifeguard stopped them before they went too far</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Did you ask her about it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> She just said it was a terrible mistake and it wouldn't happen again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Do you believe her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Staring at her drink) I'd like to</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> What does George say?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> What does George ever say? - tell me, does Timothy Hajanian show any signs of going to another school for his Ph.D.?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Fiddling with her napkin) Not that I'm aware of</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Reaching over to kiss Lydia and Shelby on the cheeks) Ladies, I am so sorry for being late, we were held up in traffic... this is Wing Mei, she is the wife of a new professor at the university</p>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Extending her hand and smiling) Of course, Dr. Dong's wife, so nice to finally meet you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> (Bowing) Hello</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Taking a seat) Wing works in the IT department of Meer-a-Mar and is interested in becoming involved with our charity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Excellent, we appreciate your interest and can always use an extra hand</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> I look forward very much to helping childrens</p>

<div class="stage">The waiter presents them with menus and they take a few moments to look them over.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> I do not want strawberry in my sal-lah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Get the Caesar Salad, Wing, it's delicious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> What is Caesar?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> So, Oni, you mentioned in your message that you wanted to speak to us about something other than the charity?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Yes, I want to talk about Vesper - I know she's a close friend of Penelope and baby-sits both Calvin and my children</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> I do not want grape in my sal-lah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> What about Vesper?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Well, I had a little talk with her yesterday about her situation and I told her it was a sign from God</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> YOU TOLD HER A COKE ADDICTION WAS A SIGN FROM GOD?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> WHAT COKE ADDICTION?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS 6 WEEKS PREGNANT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> SHE'S PREGNANT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> I do not want nut on my sal-lah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Jesus, Wing, it's a $10.00 salad, you BETTER get nuts and fruit with it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE - BACK UP... Vesper has a problem with coke and is knocked up as well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> She didn't tell me about the cocaine but that doesn't change anything</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> It doesn't?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I told Vesper to keep the baby - she had an appointment for an abortion tomorrow but I told her no, that this is a life, a sign from God that He wants her to settle down and have a family</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia &amp; Shelby</span> ARE YOU INSANE?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> I think I get Sanna Fe sal-lah - what is Sanna Fe?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I want you two to help me convince her that this is the right thing to do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia &amp; Shelby</span> YOU REALLY ARE INSANE</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I can't believe I'm hearing this - Shelby, you're an unwed mother</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> And as much as I dearly love my son, I was not ready for him in my life - I wish I had waited... I wish I had kept my legs shut!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Tell me, will the father take responsibility for Vesper's baby?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> She's not sure who the father is exactly but of the potential ones, all tell her to kill this child</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> It is a cluster of cells right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Think about what you're saying, Ona Rosa - you want this barely 20-year-old to become an unwed mother who does not have her college degree, who doesn't know exactly who the father is and is tanked up on coke and God knows what else to have a baby that you know damn well she can't care for... is that what you really want?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> She can give it up for adoption - you adopted your daughter, Lydia, you would think you would want this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> My circumstances were entirely different and we're not talking about Penny, we're talking about Vesper, and everyone sitting here at this table...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> Maybe I get duck sal-lah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Most everyone here at this table knows that Vesper is the type who would NEVER give up her child for adoption, she doesn't have it in her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I agree</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Well, I don't - I know this wonderful, infertile couple from the university club who are looking to adopt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> So, this is a baby brokering deal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Don't say it like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Oni, we all know how Vesper looks up to you like a big sister and I have to say you're taking extreme advantage of that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Don't forget, she has a coke problem - she obviously does not have the responsibility to take care of herself or this child - and we all know how drug addicted babies turn out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Is the university club couple going to want a child with Down Syndrome or worse?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I just can't believe you two want her to kill this baby!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> IT IS ONLY A CLUMP OF CELLS RIGHT NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Vesper was immature enough to get into this situation, now she needs to find the maturity to get out of this situation - it really is none of our business but I will tell you right now that if you keep telling her to keep it, I will make sure she hears ALL of the pros and cons</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I'm with Lydia</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Wing</span> I think Ona Rosa is right - they kill babies all the time in China, it is wrong... and I have roast beef sandwich</p>
