      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        "I have been an avid sci-fi/adventure/comic book fan all of my life. As much as I loved female-driven shows like Xena and
        Buffy, I grew a little tired (okay, a lot tired) of seeing all the male names as writers/creators. Darkfin is my
        attempt to continue the troubled heroine story line with the edge of actually
        knowing what PMS is truly like."<br>&mdash; Lizzy TJ
