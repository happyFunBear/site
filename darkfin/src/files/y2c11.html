<div class="stage">Inside one of the many caverns of the Kiyomi mountain range, a cluster of hooded figures gathers and chants while their white-robed leader observes. One in blue reverently approaches the one in white and they break off into another part of the cavern.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> All is going well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Mostly... we were able to confiscate everything from the anointed one but I still do not understand why we simply cannot eliminate her and the aberration at her side?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> We need them - we need all of our enemies in play</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Why? - you have failed to explain your reasoning to us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Levitating the one in blue) FAILED?</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c11_levitate.jpg" h="399" w="370"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> I APOLOGIZE - A MISFORTUNATE CHOICE OF WORDS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Dropping him to the ground) Choose your words more wisely - at the appropriate time, the others will know of my strategy... until then, it is not for them OR for YOU to question</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> (Bowing) Of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Select two subordinates and bring them to me - I have a mission for them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Scouting or conversion?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Neither</p>

<div class="stage">The blue begins to question but thinks twice.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Go... NOW</p>

<div class="stage">As the two return to the others, a nearby figure packs up some sophisticated electronic equipment and secretly waits for the subordinates to set forth. It is Joenne Mirabello.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (To herself) This is going to be interesting</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c11_joenne_cave.jpg" h="462" w="420"  b="0"></p>


<div class="stage">A digital message flashes on her phone. LOSE MARRIED GUY AND MEET US AT PIZZA PARLOR - JUSTINE. The two hooded subordinates emerge from the cave and take off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Following them) Sorry, sis, I have better things to do</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">In downtown Santa Conchita at Mama Toni's Pizza Parlor, Morrigan, KJ, Gracie, Zach, Justine, and Jason all smush together in a tiny booth with a red-checkered tablecloth. They have already finished two pizzas and are now on their third.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> I'm sorry, I know most of you are sci-fi fans but that was the LAMEST movie I ever had the misfortune of seeing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I hate to admit it, but I agree</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Crunching on her crust) That wasn't REAL sci-fi, that was Hollywood's crap version with a bunch of special effects passing off as a story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Not to mention a star vehicle for their latest &quot;IT' girl... oops, I meant &quot;TIT&quot; girl</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> (Smirking) But, it was kind of cool when she used her boobs as weapons</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c11_kj_jason.jpg" h="304" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Giving him a high-five) THAT WAS SWEET</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Well worth the price of admission!</p>

<div class="stage">The three women simultaneously roll their eyes and shake their heads.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Someday, hopefully, a solid sci-fi writer will get the chance to tell their tale on the big screen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do you ever think &quot;Sigma Seven&quot; will make it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Hoisting his beer) Here's hoping!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> If anyone could write it, Jess could</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Who's Jess?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> Warning, boring topic of conversation ahead!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Jessie Escobar is the creator and head writer for Sig7 but she's being slowly muscled out by Martel and his goons</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> God forbid anyone with real talent be allowed to flourish in this country</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> That's not true - a lot of struggling athletes have made their dreams come true</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, JOCKS, not artists!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Justine</span> (Inspecting at a dirty knife) Yet another boring topic of conversation - shouldn't there be a limit?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Before we leave the last one entirely, I found an EXCELLENT chat group devoted to Ursula/Bogree slash fic - Grace, we need to link it to our site!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Scrunching up her face) EWW, I HAVEN'T FULLY DIGESTED MY MEAL YET</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Bewildered) Does anyone know what they're talking about?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Rarely</p>

<div class="stage">A waitress in a goofy hat made of faux straw comes over to check on them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> Yeah, two more pitchers of beer, please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Smiling at Morrigan) And another Cherry Coke for the little girl in the pink sweater</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone laughs except McBride.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Picking up on Morrigan's mood) Maybe she likes Cherry Coke, man, I prefer Dr. Pepper myself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Morri, if you're a recovering alchie, just say so - it's nothing to be ashamed of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Softly) You know, Zachary, I'm getting real tired of you riding me about not drinking beer, so I think it's about time I tell you why I don't drink beer... when I was nine years old, I was in a car accident with my mother and little brother - my mom was obeying all of the traffic laws, until some drunken asshole in a huge pick-up truck crossed the center lane and barreled right into us - there wasn't even time to react - when I regained consciousness, the only things I could coherently grasp through the searing pain of my shattered leg were my brother's dying moans in the back seat and my mother's decapitated head in my lap - an hour later, after being trapped with a blaring car horn and the radio stuck on Neil Diamond, the firefighters finally freed me with the Jaws of Life and wheeled my broken body into the back of the ambulance - on the way, the very last thing I saw were two twisted piles of metal sitting in a large pool of blood and gasoline with empty Coors cans floating in it - so, no, I really do not like drinking beer - I have nothing against others enjoying themselves responsibly - but, for me, I suppose you could say, it has left a very bad taste in my mouth</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone stares at Morrigan in quiet shock.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> WHO'S UP FOR A GAME OF POOL?</p>

<p>Jason, Justine, and Zach all jump up from the table and dash off. KJ follows them but kisses Morrigan on the cheek first. It is now just her and Gracie with the pizza.</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I could say &quot;sorry&quot; but I know that doesn't even come close</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No worries - how come you stayed?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Grabbing another slice) Are you kidding? - I mean, I'm sorry for the suffering and all but THANK YOU for clearing the table!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It was a bit crowded, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I seriously had no idea Justine and Jason were going to tag along</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm a little surprised that Justine bolted like she did</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Well, she lives stories like that everyday with her job - besides, the pool table is where the men are!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Very true</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Speaking of men, what's up with you and KJ? - have you two done it yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> None of your business!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Dear God, please don't let there be some horrific story that has scarred you sexually for life!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's nothing like that... it's just - I dunno</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Is there someone else?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Defensive) NO, of course not - something's missing in our relationship, that's all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Making a crude hand gesture) That's pretty obvious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> More than that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking her beverage from the waitress) I don't know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You need to be a little more specific</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Honestly, I don't know and it's frustrating the hell out of me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Not to mention poor Kage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> He's everything I've ever wanted in a man - handsome, rich, sweet - in all of my previous relationships, I was always the one doing the romancing, tending to THEIR needs - I used to say to myself that I would become a slave to the first man who bought me flowers or chocolate without having to fucking beg for it... and don't even get me started on &quot;The Hope for Poetry&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Chuckling) I hear ya!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sipping her soda) And now KJ has given me all of that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Nearly choking on her beer) HE WROTE YOU POETRY?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Actually, it was a Hallmark card... that counts</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Five points</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> He signed the card &quot;Love, Your Rockin' Lawyer Dude&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Three points off</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Four - anyway, he's just not &quot;deep&quot; enough for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Funny, he is the one guy that I know who would be just as comfortable making 50K a year as he does making 500, so what if he's a little dim or a little shallow?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> He is actually very smart but he's too casual about life... and girlfriends</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Mmm, NOW we're getting closer to the truth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not to mention, Mrs. Javier Sanchez</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Don't worry, I'm sure that little obsession will pass</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> As will his obsession with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why do you see it as that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Because it is - I'm something new, a little different - he'll get tired and return to his bimbos soon enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Jeez, give him a chance, first</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's really hard - when we're out to dinner, I wonder to myself, has he brought all of the others to this place as well? - when we listen to a certain song, will that be OUR song or is it a song he was banging some girl to last summer? - these questions are always in the back of my mind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Sounds like insecurity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe, but I choose to see it more as &quot;pride&quot; - pride in knowing that I didn't have to bed half of the state to fall in love with someone who feels exactly the same way about me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> But you're missing out on a lot of good times</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> See, that's where our standards differ - I don't trivialize love with lust</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Do your standards keep you warm at night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Of course not - I don't expect them to - unlike most of the population out there, I don't allow my body to dictate my actions - my head and my heart do enough damage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> If it makes you feel any better, I can assure you that you will always be KJ's &quot;Morrigan&quot; - your name is just too weird for him to have had any others... now I, on the other hand, was my ex-husband's &quot;Gracie #3&quot; - can you believe that? - I never knew when he was screaming out my name during sex if it was me, his sophomore year blonde Gracie or the trannie named &quot;Amazin' Grace&quot; he picked up on a street corner in Miami... now, there's a case for insecurity!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her head) Dear Lord!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking at her watch) WOW, we've been together all night and you haven't tried to duck out once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sorry for being so anti-social lately, I have a lot of things to research</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Suspicious) Like Darkfin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No - I'm digging something up, literally, on the Pacific Coast Oil Cartel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The story is far from ready and I can't trust Zach with it yet, if he goes to print... it will screw up the timing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why can't you let me in on this? - we work for the same team, maybe I can help you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know and when it's time, I'll need you there... but not yet</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie sits back in exasperation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You've got to trust me on this, Takanachi... PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Fine - but, if I were you, I wouldn't be sitting here...</p>

<div class="stage">Fingers nods over to KJ at the pool table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'd be PUMPING my prime PCOC source</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not a bad idea</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan's cell phone rings.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Answering it) Hello?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Hola, Senorita McBride - this is Hector Tapia returning your call from earlier?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ah, Hector - thank you so much</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> You wanted to find out some details about the Chumash burial grounds in the Kiyomis?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, I was hoping you could help me out with that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I know a little bit but I also know someone who would be more of a help to you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> GREAT - where can I meet this person?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Come to your church, pronto!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> St. B's?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> My sister, Carmen, is here on behalf of Our Lady of Guadalupe - inter-parish business and such - anyway, she knows everything and would be the perfect source for you</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan flashes back to Anita Fiore's heirloom bracelet.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Perfect - I'll be there in 10 minutes... muchas gracias, Hector!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Always at your service!</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan chuckles to herself as she puts away her phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Now where are you off to?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Church</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> With Hector Tapia? - yeah, right!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Dashing off) Please say goodnight to the others for me</p>

<div class="stage">Inside the main hall of Saint Brendan's Catholic Church, several people are gathered among the priests to discuss parish business. Frank Fiore and his wife, Carmen, sit in the front row while Hector repairs on one of the broken tables.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Arms folded) I don't know why you dragged me here - I should be home, watching wrestling with my grandchildren</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Ona Rosa took them to see that new sci-fi movie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> I should be home helping Anita fix the barn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> She is playing at a club tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> I should be...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> A supportive husband</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Argh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Do I make the slightest complaint when you and your buddies bring home dead animal carcasses for me to clean?</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c11_frank_carmen.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"></p>


<div class="stage">Frank taps his cane on the ground in defiance as Hector returns to their side.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Carmie - I hope you don't mind, but I invited a friend to join us later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> A lady friend, hermano?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Struggling with his coffee) What other kind would there be?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> It's Morrigan McBride and she needs your help with a story she's doing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Eyes lighting up) That KCON girl who saved the dog - I LIKE her!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (In a huff) Anita talks about her all the time as if she were the harbinger of doom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> That's because she has failed to succumb to your daughter's charms</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Covering her ears) NOT HERE, NOT IN CHURCH</p>

<div class="stage">An amused Frank accidentally spills some coffee on his shirt.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> AW, CHRIST</p>

<div class="stage">The priests turn around and glare.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Amen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> What does this McBride want to know, Hector?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> About the Chumash... particularly the burial grounds in the Kiyomis</p>

<div class="stage">Carmen turns several shades of white and does not answer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Noticing) Is everything alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Looking away) Both of you need to be quiet... Padre Juan is about to bring up Guadalupe concerns</p>

<div class="stage">Now pulling into Saint Brendan's parking lot, Morrigan turns off the ignition and gets out of her car. Out of the corner of her eye, she notices someone lurking in the bushes by the steps, away from the main lighting.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Assuming it's Darkfin) You know, Bouillabaisse, you have got to come up with a better way of contacting me</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is stunned when Joenne Mirabello steps out from the bushes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Startled) JOENNE... Justine's sister, right? - we met that day outside the morgue</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne simply stares at her.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c11_morri_joenne.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sorry - are you on your way to the meeting? - please don't let me keep you</p>

<div class="stage">Joenne does not budge and continues to say nothing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Nervous) Are... are you alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> No... and neither are you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> If you value your life... do NOT go inside!</p>
