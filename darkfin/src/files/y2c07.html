<div class="stage">Inside the private office of Dr. Stephanie Gates, Morrigan lies on an exam table in a blue paper gown. She glances at her watch, counts the panels in the ceiling and then stares at nondescript poster art on the wall. The doctor finally returns with an armful of charts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Shutting the door behind her) Sorry to keep you waiting, Morrigan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No problem, I understand how busy you are</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Opening up a file) I just love that name &quot;Morrigan&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you for pronouncing it correctly - now, without looking at the chart, can you spell it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Looking away) M-O-R-R-I-G-A-N</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pleased) Excellent!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Taking out her stethoscope) I'm even familiar with the Celtic goddess behind it</p>

<div class="stage">A surprised Morrigan smiles as the doctor listens to her heart and lungs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Big breath... again... good</p>

<div class="stage">She checks her blood pressure and then writes down the info in the charts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> A few years back for my birthday, my youngest son took me to New York City to see &quot;Riverdance&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How thoughtful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Brad was so proud of himself for getting front row seats... I'm sure you're familiar with Irish dancing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Figuring out what happened) Oh, no!</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c07_dr_steph.jpg" h="380" w="320"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Uh-huh - the stage was elevated, the only thing I saw for the entire show were rigid torsos and stone faces</p>

<div class="stage">The doctor does an imitation, causing her patient to burst out laughing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> My son is generally well-meaning but he can be so obtuse</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Unsure of what to say) Huh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I admire your parents, I wanted to be more ethnic with my children's names but my husband at the time wouldn't hear of it - he thought he bestowed a great gift upon me by letting me use &quot;Griffin&quot; - now he lets his new wife name their baby &quot;Ivan&quot;... go figure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Now, is it Dr. Gates or Dr. Martel? - I heard both when I was at Bay Valley</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Smirking) I was Dr. Martel for most of my career, it's pretty hard for some people to forget - but, since I am no longer Mrs. Martel, Dr. Gates is preferable</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Dr. Gates it is - by the way, I really appreciate you seeing me as a patient, your secretary said you rarely accept new ones</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Taking Morrigan's pulse) Between the daily chaos at the hospital and the medical insurance industry, there simply aren't enough hours in the day... but I wanted to make an exception for my favorite dog rescuer</p>

<div class="stage">The doctor winks as Morrigan rolls her eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I am never going to live that down!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Checking her eyes) You shouldn't... a dog saved my life once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Curious) Really?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Quickly) Another time - so, how have you been doing since the big Santa Conchita River mess?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Well, that's why I'm here - I'm not normally comfortable with doctors but I feel comfortable with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Thank you, I appreciate that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Everything is fine except... I've been having a few dizzy spells and I'm lightheaded at times</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I don't recall any severe head trauma from the train accident - is your vision affected?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, not really</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Any other symptoms?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Nope - actually, I have been under a lot of stress lately</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> A new city, a new job - that could very well be the trigger</p>

<div class="stage">The doctor takes Morrigan's temperature and then abruptly leaves the office for a minute. She returns moments later with a look of concern on her face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sitting up) So, are we finished?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Going through the folder) Not quite - I just needed to look at your labs and I want to recheck something</p>

<div class="stage">The physician motions for her to be quiet as she takes her temperature again. She finishes and goes back to her charts.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is everything alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> For the most part, it is</p>

<div class="stage">A look of panic crosses McBride's face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Reaching her hand out) Relax, relax - you're fine - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Exhaling) I should know better about getting all of the facts before jumping to conclusions</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> All of your tests fall into the normal range... except</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know - my body temperature</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Taking a seat in front of her) In all of my years as a physician, I have never seen such dramatic fluctuations in a person's Basal temp before - it literally happens in minutes!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, my dad used to joke that it changed quicker than Miami weather</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I noticed this when you were brought into the ER after the train wreck - I attributed it to the overall stress of the situation, hypothermia from being in the river, even a reaction to the chemicals from the spill - but it shouldn't still be happening after all of this time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It has been happening as far back as I can remember</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Perplexed) I've checked your thyroid, there are no signs of an immunological illness, your hormone levels are fine, no illegal drug use or obvious allergies</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I've heard it all before - just blame it on my genes, that's what other doctors have done</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Does anyone else in your family have this trait?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> None that I'm aware of</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. Gates stares at some charts and unconsciously taps the tip of her pen against them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Besides the train incident, have there been any other health-related events in your life?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking down) I was in a car crash when I was nine - it left me with a bruised liver, a nasty concussion and my leg was broken in three places, otherwise, nothing permanent... physically</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Comforting touch) Anything else happen to you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Thinking) No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Well then, I can't find any solid reason for your abnormal temperatures - I would like to do a few more tests</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Actually, doctor, what I'm more concerned about are the dizzy spells and lightheadedness</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I am, too - that's why I want to do some more tests</p>

<div class="stage">The office phone rings causing the doctor to excuse herself as she takes the call. As Morrigan tries not to listen to the conversation about another patient, she suddenly spots a shadow right under the foot of the door. It remains there for a moment until Dr. Gates finishes her phone call.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Returning to Morrigan) Now, about those tests</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Interrupting) I will need some time to think about it - I'm not a big fan of tests... besides, I think your next patient is here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I'm not seeing anyone else today - listen, Morrigan, I know certain medical procedures can seem a little daunting but I strongly recommend that you have them done - dizzy spells and lightheadedness are symptoms that cannot be ignored</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting dressed) I know, and I will seriously consider having them done, just not right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Please promise me that you'll come back and see me right away if they intensify</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Finishing buttoning) I will and thank you again for seeing me</p>

<div class="stage">The two walk out of the room and into the main office where Hector Tapia sits on a leather couch, reading a medical journal. Both women are surprised to see him as he smiles and stands.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Most people believe the text in these journals is dry and dull but I find it to be quite invigorating - what do you think, Ms. McBride?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh... it can be, I suppose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Taking the younger woman's hand and gently squeezing it) I know you're a reporter but all quality reporters are writers at heart, wouldn't you agree?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (A little embarrassed) One would hope so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> AHEM, Mr. Tapia... I wasn't expecting you today</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c07_hector.jpg" h="379" w="420"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I just need a few moments of your time, Stephi, it won't take long</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Thinking to herself) Stephi!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Turning back to Morrigan) I can't thank you enough for your wonderful piece on the county prison system - a lot of important people took notice and now, finally, some things are getting done</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I couldn't have reported the story without you as my main source, thank YOU, Mr. Tapia</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Call me Hector, por favor - and if you need any ideas for another segment, I'd be more than willing to help out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll be sure to do that, Hector</p>

<div class="stage">The petite brunette smiles at the older man with a young appearance and makes her way towards the exit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> By the way, I saw you at mass the other day at St. Brendan's</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Turning around) I didn't know were a parishioner there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Normally, I'm not, but I had some business to take care of with a clergy member - I usually attend Our Lady of Guadalupe with my family</p>

<div class="stage">This causes a tiny snicker of laughter from Morrigan. Both Hector and Stephanie look at her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sorry, I just had an amusing mental image of your niece in church</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Grinning and nodding) Ah, I take it you aren't referring to Ona Rosa?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Anita is quite the Fiore family character!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Biting his lip) I hope you won't hold that against me</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan blushes as Stephanie glares at Hector.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I really should be on my way - thank you, again, Dr. Gates</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I hope to hear from you soon, Morrigan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Goodbye</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Hey, if you're ever interested in a Tridentine mass, Our Lady has them every Saturday night at seven!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Freezing in her tracks) Did you say Tridentine?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> The indult Traditional Latin Mass</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I know what it is... I was unaware that they had them here in Santa Conchita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Well, now you know - I hope to see you there sometime</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan offers a quick smile and finally takes off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Closing the door) Good God, Hector, could you be anymore obvious?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I'm just providing the pretty lady with options</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> She's young enough to be your daughter!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Smirking) True... but she's not!</p>

<div class="stage">Dr. Gates takes a seat behind her Queen Anne style desk and stares at a picture of her children - Ben, Griffin, Brad and Victoria.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Leaning over the desk) And how is your daughter doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (Scowling) Why are you here?</p>

<div class="stage">The man casually reaches over and takes the phone off of the hook.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> You know exactly why</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Stopping off at a deli to get a chicken focaccia sandwich, Morrigan returns to her car and speeds off down the coast. She pulls into an isolated turn-out by the shore and parks under a grove of shrubs and palm trees. She opens a file entitled PCOC and begins to read through the company's annual report, as well as, recent drilling proposals along the coast. A few hours later, she begins to doze off.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (In her sleep) Why? - where do you come from? - nosce tuam horam... NO, STOP, AAAHHHH</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan startles herself out of sleep and groggily tries to recall where she is. She gazes out at a star-filled sky over the ocean.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Checking her watch) Damn, how long did I sleep?</p>

<div class="stage">She rubs her eyes and tosses the PCOC folder into the back seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> They should package that material as an insomnia cure... better call Gracie and tell her I'm going to be late</p>

<div class="stage">As she picks up her cell phone and begins to dial, the battery goes dead.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Throwing it down on the seat next to her) THAT'S JUST GREAT - first, the doctor wants more tests, then a source falls in love with me because of a successful story, then comes a lost afternoon of heartburn, dense reading material, a never-ending nightmare, and now my freaking phone... WHAT'S NEXT?</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, a thunderous thump on the hood shakes the entire car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Cowering in her seat) NEVERMIND, I DON'T WANNA KNOW</p>

<div class="stage">The upside down head of Darkfin now peers at her through the windshield.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sighing and shaking her head) I just HAD to ask</p>

<div class="stage">Slowly getting out of the white Mustang, Morrigan is now face to face with Aleta Oscura.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Would you mind getting off of my car or do you want to pay for the scratched paint?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin leaps down.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you - how did you know where to find... you know what, forget it, I won't get a straight answer out of you - you probably have &quot;Pipi the Pelican Spy&quot; following me around or maybe more hooded thugs... or GASP even your magic wand ITSELF, WOOOO - so, let's just get right down to it - WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME NOW?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Folding her arms) Are you finished?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Doing the same) Maybe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Taking her hand) Follow me</p>

<div class="stage">She leads the petite brunette down to the edge of the shore and throws her a black and blue wetsuit. Morrigan looks baffled.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It is time for your swimming lesson</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Throwing it down) So it WAS you who IMed me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Put it on, we have places to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Defiantly) Not until you tell me WHERE and WHY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> We need to go to my lair and because I said so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, your LAIR? - is that down the street from the Batcave or are you flying me off to Paradise Island in the invisible jet? - OH MY GOD, now I'm channeling Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Getting in her face) I realize that sarcasm and witty wordplay are your only sources of defense and employment, but please try to restrain yourself for the next hour or two</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan drops to the ground and sweeps Darkfin's legs out from under her, knocking the creature on her backside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Back on her feet) Sarcasm isn't my only defense</p>

<div class="stage">Quickly standing and bowing to Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I apologize - I need you to come with me... please - I would like to conduct a few tests, take a blood sample from you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh, NOT you too!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> What do you mean?</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c07_morri_wetsuit.jpg" h="526" w="220"  b="0" a="center"/>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I just spent the day at the doctors getting poked and prodded - I'm not about to waste my precious evening doing the same</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Which doctor?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You mean, Pipi didn't tell you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Eyes blazing) WHICH DOCTOR?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Stepping back) Dr. Stephanie Gates</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin retreats and looks away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You know who she is, don't you?</p>

<div class="stage">McBride struts up to Darkfin and cocks her head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> DON'T YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Bearing her teeth) PUT... THIS... WETSUIT... ON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OR?</p>

<div class="stage">With a rapid, precision slash of her armfin, Darkfin sends Morrigan's blouse to the ground.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Or go naked</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Hurrying away) You are SO paying for this blouse</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan strips off the rest of the clothes down to her underwear and struggles to put the form-fitting suit on.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I can't believe I'm being dictated to by a giant green mermaid - why the hell do I need to take a test? - I'M not the freak of nature here!</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin grabs Morrigan's left ankle out from under her, knocking the woman back hard against the sand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Holding up the foot to expose the triskele birthmark) ARE YOU NOT?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin throws the leg down as a silent Morrigan unsuccessfully tries to hold back her tears.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Holding out her hand) We need to go</p>

<div class="stage">Slapping it away, Morrigan scrambles to her feet and strides towards the ocean.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Following) How long can you hold your breath?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Unzipping the arms and legs of the wetsuit) I don't have the slightest idea</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I suppose we will find out soon enough</p>

<div class="stage">Now with the arm and leg sections in her hand, the petite brunette flings them in disgust at Aleta Oscura.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Catching them) You will need these for protection against the cold</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Tears still streaming down her face) No, I won't - in fact, I'll overheat... and I'm betting you know EXACTLY why that is!</p>
