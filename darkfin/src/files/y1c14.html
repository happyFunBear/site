    <div class="body">
      

<div class="stage">Utter pandemonium breaks out in the museum as it's thrown into darkness with the sound of glass shattering.Still on the ceiling,
  Darkfin is able to sense the movement with her sonar and zeros in on three guards making off with the Duquesa's Tears.
  Gliding down to the floor, she gives chase through the main hall and out into the sculpture garden.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Guard #1</span> (Looking over his shoulder) WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Guard #2:</span> (Pulling out his gun) JUST KEEP MOVING</p>

<p>

</p>


<div class="stage">Before he can get off a round, the mysterious sea creature with the woman's body grabs his hand, crushing his wrist with
  one simple squeeze.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Guard #2</span> AAAAAAHHHH</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin quickly searches him for the necklace. Turning up nothing, she lifts the guard with ease and hurls him into an adjacent
  courtyard. Fear and confusion grip the first guard as he tries to decide between helping his associate or fleeing. The
  sight of the sleek green glistening marine monster leaping over to him in one, smooth move freezes the man in his tracks.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Now looking right into his eyes) Give me the necklace and I'll give you your life</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Guard #1</span> (Trembling and losing bladder control) I... I... don't... I don't have it... I SWEAR</p>

<div class="stage">The feel of the cold, slimy hands searching his body is too much for the guard to endure and he passes out in her arms. The
  sound of automatic gunfire fills the air and the splattering of the man's blood and brains hits Darkfin in the face. Twisting
  and tumbling to safety, she locates a separate shooter behind a bush and charges. He fires more shots but the bullets bounce
  off of her protective scales like dried macaroni shells. One, however, does pierce her head fin membrane, evoking a rage
  reaction. With two swift moves, the gun is smashed against a cement wall and the shooter is sent flying into a large sculpture
  where he is impaled on the long, metal spikes.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Climbing up and searching the shooter for the necklace) The third guard must have it</p>

<div class="stage">She tests the wind and jumps off in that direction.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Back inside the museum, the emergency lights are activated, revealing knocked over tables, discarded masks and spilled food.
  Six people are lying on the ground from being trampled in the stampede to get out of the building. Morrigan quickly assesses
  the situation and runs out of the main hall.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> MOM</p>

<div class="stage">Lydia Renselier lies on the floor, covered with glass from the shattered display case. She struggles to get up as her daughter
  and husband run to her side.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Noticing the cuts all over her) What happened?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> DON'T MOVE - SOMEONE GET AN AMBULANCE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">George</span> (Covering his flapper-clad wife with his vintage coat) Just stay calm, Lyd</p>

<div class="stage">The Mayor of Barcelona, surrounded by security, hurries over to them.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Mayor</span> THE DUQUESA'S TEARS, THEY'RE GONE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> WHAT? - NOOO</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">George</span> (Running off) I'll go call the police</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> DAD, GET BACK HERE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Looking around at the scene in front of her) Forget him, Penny - go help those people!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> I'm not leaving you!</p>

<div class="stage">A now wigless Karl von Meer comes over to the mother and daughter.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Are you two alright?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Pushing at girl's arm) PLEASE HELP THEM, PENELOPE, I CAN'T</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trying not to cry) Mr. Von Meer, could you please stay with my mom?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Stooping beside them) Sure thing, Honey</p>

<div class="stage">Casting off her bent dragonfly wings, Penny goes over to one of the injured on the floor as Captain Phelps takes charge,
  despite his drunken buccaneer appearance.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> EVERYONE, PLEASE REMAIN CALM - I REPEAT, REMAIN CALM - THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL</p>

<div class="stage">KJ, Ona Rosa and a couple of doctors at the party, shed themselves of their costume accessories and spread out to assist
  the injured. Sandy pokes his helmeted head out from behind a statue.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Javier</span> Is it safe?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">One Rosa</span> GET OVER HERE AND HELP US</p>

<div class="stage">Penny finishes taking care of an injured woman and goes over to an older man lying motionless on the floor.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Removing his costume) Oh my God, it's Mr. Braemar - I don't think he's breathing!</p>

<div class="stage">Two menacing cowboy boots stand in front of her, prompting Penny to look up and see Brad's nonchalant face.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> What happened, did you knee him in the nuts too?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> QUICK, CHECK HIS PULSE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> (Doing so) What pulse?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Positioning herself over his chest) SHIT, DO YOU KNOW CPR?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> I know how to get someone started again after an overdose</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Preparing to start chest compressions) Clear his throat, tilt his head back and pinch his nose - when I
  tell you, breathe into his mouth</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Brad</span> I'll tell you what, YOU breathe into this corpse's mouth and I will pound on his chest!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trading places) FINE, LET'S MOVE</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin and Pauline, still immaculate in their costumes, make their way over to Karl and Lydia.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> This is an absolute disaster!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Holding Lydia's trembling hand) Now is not the time to state the obvious, Dear</p>

<div class="stage">Mrs. von Meer is taken aback by her husband's tone.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Griffin</span> Where's Erika?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> I thought she was with you?</p>

<div class="stage">The eldest Martel brother hurries off.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Pauline</span> (To Lydia) Darling, do you want me to get you some water?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Lydia</span> Just see if you can find my other crutch... and my husband</p>

<div class="stage">Standing in a corner holding his hockey stick for protection, Douglas Martel comforts his wife, Ursula as she wipes shrimp
  fondue off of her gold dress and carries on uncontrollably.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Douglas</span> Shh, Sweetie - you can cut the acting showcase, everyone is too busy to pay attention to you</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Bopping him hard on the arm) You insensitive stone, can you not see how upset I am?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Douglas</span> (Spotting Lydia) Yeah, right - I need to go help my sister!</p>

<div class="stage">The second Mrs. Douglas Martel grabs his arm, causing him to spin back around.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Ursula</span> She is your sister, I AM YOUR WIFE - I am frightened and I wish to go home, NOW</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Douglas</span> But</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Ursula</span> Our son is waiting for us</p>

<div class="stage">Observing others surrounding a now-standing Lydia, the Martel patriarch is pushed aside by several police officers and paramedics.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Douglas</span> (Sighing) Let's go</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">A 1977 red metallic Pontiac Firebird sits with its windows fogged up in a remote part of the museum parking lot. Unaware
  of the chaos nearby, Anita is getting hot and heavy with the cocktail waitress. Three loud pounds on the hood startle them.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> ANITA</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Cracking the window) CRUNCH, ARE YOU PLASTERED?</p>

<p>
  <img b="0" h="92" w="300" src="../assets/images/y1c14_firebird.gif" a="center">
</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Throwing open the car door) GET OUT OF THE CAR, GET OUT OF THE CAR, GET OUT OF THE CAR</p>

<div class="stage">The startled cocktail waitress stumbles out, trying to find her panties.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> MOVE IT, MOVE IT</p>

<div class="stage">Forgetting her panties, the cocktail waitress takes off in tears while Anita comes close to decking her captain.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> WE NEED TO GET AIRBORNE</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Fixing her rumpled bar wench look) I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE DRESSED LIKE THIS</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Grabbing her shoulder and pointing to the museum) GET THE PUBIC HAIR OUT OF YOUR TEETH AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> Jesus Christ, what happened? - ONI</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Jumping in the driver's seat) Your sister is fine</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> WHY ARE THERE AMBULANCES, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> GIMME THE KEYS, LET'S GO</p>

<div class="stage">The reluctant lieutenant follows his orders and the car squeals out of the parking lot. Using the emergency frequency on
  his radio, the captain starts barking orders.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> I WANT ALL AVAILABLE SHIPS TO CONVERGE ON SECTOR NINE IMMEDIATELY</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> (Watching the KCON newsvan pass them in the opposite direction) I'm still waiting for an explanation</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> The Duquesa's Tears were stolen right in front of everyone</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> What happened to security?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> Good question - the lights went out, it went down too fast</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> Where are we going? - shouldn't we be there to help?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> THINK - if you just stole a multi-million dollar necklace in front of 250 people, what would you do?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Anita</span> Get out of town... and into International Waters</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Craig</span> (Stepping on the gas) That's why we need to be in the bird</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie and Zach pull up to the entrance of the museum as the injured are being taken away in ambulances. With video camera
  and notepad in tow, the two rush inside.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Do you see Morri?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> Not yet</p>

<p>
  <img b="0" h="208" w="300" src="../assets/images/y1c9_newsvan.gif" a="center">
</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Damn, that girl was on the money again!</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> I don't get it, how did she know?</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Said some weirdo tipped her off with a freaky poem</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Motioning to a bystander) I need to start asking questions, if I see her, I'll let you know</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Taping footage) Go ahead, I'll check back with you in ten</p>

<div class="stage">The petite, pudgy field producer pauses for a moment and scans the faces.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Where are you, Morrigan McBride?</p>

<div class="stage">Now in the sculpture garden, the faux Lois Lane carefully looks around. She feels a wet tapping on her shoulder and goes
  to touch it. Her finger returns with blood. Directly above her is the shooter's body impaled on the spike.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Covering her mouth) OH GOD</p>

<div class="stage">Not taking her eyes off the sight above her, she stumbles back and nearly falls over the bullet-riddled body of the guard.
  Before Morrigan can scream for help, she spots a cloaked figure hurrying across a field with a large sack. Her instincts
  tell her to follow and she obeys.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Bolting towards the bay, Darkfin uses her keen sense of smell to pursue the third guard that eluded her. She finally spots
  the culprit near a jetty and tackles the woman to the ground.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Searching her) Where is the necklace?</p>

<div class="stage">The smiling guard says nothing and spits in her captor's face.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Slapping her hard) I'm not going to repeat myself</p>

<div class="stage">With one crack of her jaw, the guard swallows something and begins to convulse. She expires within seconds.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Kicking the body into the water) Great</p>

<div class="stage">With the throbbing in her wounded fin increasing, she takes a deep breath and prepares to dive into the welcoming sea. A
  strange, male voice echoes in back of her.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Figure</span> (Holding up the pearl necklace) Looking for this?</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin spins around and studies her cloaked opponent.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Figure</span> (Tossing her the Duquesa's Tears) It's all yours - we have what we came for</p>

<div class="stage">Catching it, she briefly glances at the necklace and notices the missing clasp. Fanning out her arm fins, she sets herself
  for an attack as does the figure. Making the first move, Darkfin throws herself at the tall man and tries to grab a hold
  of him. He's too quick and lands a blow to her ribs. She kicks his legs out from under him but he flips away.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Scrambling to her feet) SHOW YOURSELF</p>

<div class="stage">He appears, as if out of thin air, behind her at the end of the jetty.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Figure</span> Don't waste our time</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Whirling around) That's a nice trick, I have one as well</p>

<div class="stage">With a simple hand motion, Darkfin summons her trident. It comes soaring out of the water, into its owner's grasp.</div>


<p>
  <img b="0" h="72" w="504" src="../assets/images/y1c14_trident.gif">
</p>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Aiming at her target) You have ten seconds to explain before I skewer your spleen</p>
<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Figure</span> (With a laugh in his voice) Another time, that I promise</p>

<div class="stage">Losing patience, Darkfin bangs the bottom of the trident down for the charge.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Hurling it) I gave you a chance</p>

<div class="stage">The trident nears it target and suddenly veers off into one of the rocks. For the first time in her altered state, Darkfin
  feels a small pang of fear as the cloaked opponent moves towards her. Bearing her pointy barracuda teeth and running right
  at the figure, she passes through him at the moment of impact and ends up in the ocean.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Quickly surfacing) NO</p>

<div class="stage">Even with heightened senses and extraordinary abilities, the nautical oddity cannot track her new, ethereal enemy. Still
  clutching the necklace, she pauses in thought as the fog thickens around her.</div>

<p class="line">
  <span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Yet another complication</p>
