<div class="stage">Inside the Santa Conchita Municipal Courthouse, Judge Victoria Martel hears her last case for the day.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Looking at a file) Now, Mr.... am I pronouncing this right? - Balzonya?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Defendant</span> Just call me &quot;Harry,&quot; your honor</p>

<div class="stage">Snickering is heard throughout the courtroom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Taking off her glasses) Is that your real name, sir?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Defendant</span> I had it legally changed three years ago</p>

<div class="stage">More snickering.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> OK then... Harry - since this is your first offense, I'm going to go easy this time - I hope you realize that public indecency is not a laughing matter, get caught doing it again and you'll be looking at some hard time</p>

<div class="stage">The snickering turns into bursts of chuckles.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Banging down her gavel) I'll have order in this courtroom, people!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Defendant</span> But, your honor, since I am hung like a camel, I feel it is my birthright to share my genetic blessing with the fine citizens of Duquesa Bay</p>

<div class="stage">Someone from the courtroom pipes up.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Person</span> What, Quartz Lake can't get in on the action?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Turning red) MY PATIENCE IS WAFER THIN - the next person to say something inappropriate is going to get slapped with a $500.00 fine - now, Mr. Balzonya, after reviewing the photographic evidence, you really have nothing to be proud of, sir, but if you insist on doing this again, I'm sure plenty of inmates would be more than happy if you shared your show with them... am I making myself clear?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Defendant</span> JUDGE MARTEL, I AM ORDERING YOU...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Standing up) YOU ARE ORDERING ME?</p>

<div class="stage">A portable CD player is flipped on and the man jumps to the front of the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Defendant</span> (Stripping to the music) I AM ORDERING YOU TO HAVE A GOOD TIME ON YOUR BIRTHDAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> WHAT?</p>

<div class="stage">The courtroom is now filled with grinning attorneys and other courtroom personnel. They all clap and cheer as Mr. Balzonya does his little dance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> THIS... this is supposed to be a room of decorum!</p>

<div class="stage">The room breaks out into a chant. HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, FROM ALL OF US TO YOU, WE WISH IT WAS OUR BIRTHDAY, SO WE COULD PARTY TOO, YAY.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Covering her face) Oh my God</p>

<div class="stage">She turns to her friend and bailiff, Cubby, an older Filipino man.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> I'm going to get your for this, Cub</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cubby</span> The stripper was Judge Cohan's idea</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Shaking her head) I'm sure it was</p>

<div class="stage">A huge sheet cake with the words &quot;Happy Birthday Vic - Age 29: Part VI&quot; written in frosting, is brought over to her bench.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> This is carrot cake, I hate carrot cake!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cubby</span> Yes, but it was the only cake they had that was big enough to feed all of these people</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Well, I hope they enjoy it</p>

<div class="stage">About 20 minutes later, the room empties out of well-wishers, cake-eaters, Cubby and Mr. Balzonya. Now alone with her thoughts and her uneaten piece of cake, Victoria slips the birthday card containing various Disney characters and the signatures of her co-workers into her briefcase and exits the room. She calls her mother, Dr. Stephanie Gates, on a cell phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Hi Mom, I'm leaving the courthouse now, I'll meet you at the club for dinner in...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Hi Sweetie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Oh, I was just leaving you a message</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Listen, Vikki, I hate to do this to you but a long-time patient of mine was just brought in with a severe MI, I need to stay at the hospital - do you mind if we have dinner tomorrow night, instead?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Ah... no, that's fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I'm really sorry, Honey</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> No, Mom, I completely understand... I hope you patient pulls through</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I'll call you tomorrow... happy birthday</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Thanks... 'bye</p>

<div class="stage">The woman flips off her cell phone and ambles down the massive hallway.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Under her breath) I hope the sucker dies</p>

<div class="stage">Coming down the stairs is Ona Rosa Sanchez with a client.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Hey, Oni!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Smiling) Hello, Vikki</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> My plans just got changed for dinner - how about we discuss next week's charity auction over a meal at that new Italian place?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Ooh, shoot - I'd love to but this is one of those rare nights that my husband will be home for dinner - how about we go for lunch tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Forcing a smile) That sounds great</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I'll see you then... oh, and happy birthday!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Before she leaves the building, Victoria spots another co-worker on his own.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Judge Haskins, I was wondering if you'd like to discuss the re-election campaign over drinks tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Judge</span> (Rushing out the door) I'd love to, Martel, but your carrot cake has given me the runs - we'll discuss it later this week - oh, and congratulations on getting older!</p>

<div class="stage">Now alone in the underground parking garage, Victoria is about to climb into her burgundy SUV when a black truck screeches around the corner and pulls up next to her. Brad Martel jumps out with a gift.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Jesus, Bradley, you scared the living crap out of me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Kissing his sister's cheek) Sorry, Vic, Happy B-day!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Thanks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> How old are you now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> 35</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Wow, you're old!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Opening her gift) Shut up, Squirt - is this a candle?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Yeah, from my new shop</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> I HATE candles - you know the scents make me gag</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> C'mon, it's a cardinal rule that all chicks like candles!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> I'm not like &quot;all chicks&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> No shit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> I wanted a new nine iron</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Oh, Griffin has got you covered there - he bought you a new set of clubs</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Excellent, he's my favorite brother for this year</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Except he thinks your birthday is next week</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> I strike my previous statement from the record</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Aren't you supposed to be doing something with Ben and Claudia?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Rolling her eyes) Yeah, this weekend - since little Hannah's birthday is two days after mine, we're doing a combo celebration at Chuck E. Cheese this weekend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Making a face) HA HA</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Knock it off or I'll drag you along</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Hey, while I'm here - do you think you can fix a speeding ticket for me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> OH, BRADLEY, PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> It's just a little one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> FINE... but you're taking me out to dinner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Can't - gotta concert at SCU to promote tonight... you're welcome to tag along</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> What band is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> A post-punk trio called &quot;The Sickening Christians&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> On second thought... no</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I'll make them thrash out &quot;Un-happy Birthday&quot; to you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> That's OK, you go and have a good time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I thought you were supposed to have dinner with mom?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> She's stuck at the hospital</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Surprise - what about dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> He sent me some flowers and the same gold earrings he bought Ursula for her birthday</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I love our parents - look, if we hurry, we could swing by a sandwich shop or something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Giving her brother a hug) I appreciate that, I really do, but the dress shop had a nice lunch for me today - you go on to your concert and we'll have dinner another time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Returning the hug) Oh, and Vic...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Don't worry, I'll take care of the ticket</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Winking) I was going to say &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Watching him hop back into his truck) Uh-huh, 'bye Bradley!</p>

<div class="stage">Now home alone in her fine antique-furnished townhouse, Victoria gets into an on-line debate over Sigma Seven's &quot;Bogree&quot; while rubbing the belly of her Cocker Spaniel with her foot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Typing furiously) I don't agree with the direction the character is taking - she's being deconstructed in front of our eyes for silly, ratings-ploy reasons - it's disturbing!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">On-line chatter</span> dUde U R distrubing bogree totally ROCKS now U SUCK:-PPPPP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> WHY AM I DOING THIS?</p>

<div class="stage">Victoria shuts off her computer and dials her phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Hey you - I hope all is going well with the conference in Denver - um, I miss you - if I didn't have an important case tomorrow, I'd fly over there tonight - and thanks of for the electronic greeting card... it means a lot, 'bye</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/v13_victoria_bread.jpg" h="534" w="420"  b="0"></p>


<div class="stage">With a huge sigh, Victoria pads over to her kitchen and pulls out a loaf of pumpernickel bread, along with a stick of butter. She takes a thin, solitary candle, sticks it into the bread and lights it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Happy happy birthday, from all of us to you, we wish it was our birthday, so we could party too... yay</p>

<div class="stage">As she blows out the candle, her phone rings. She nearly trips over the dog running to answer it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> Hello?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Deep voice</span> Why don't you come and celebrate with us tonight, Victoria?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> (Shaken) I TOLD YOU, I WANT NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH YOU PSYCHOS - STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME</p>

<div class="stage">She slams down the phone and rips the cord out of the wall. Taking her bread, butter, and the dog, Victoria retreats into her bedroom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Victoria</span> I wonder if I'm going to make another 35 years?</p>
