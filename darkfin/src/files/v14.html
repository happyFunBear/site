  <h1>Vignette 14</h1><h2>&quot;Three Years To The Day&quot;</h2>
 <p><img src="../assets/images/von_meer_house.jpg" width="470" height="345" border="0"></p>


<div class="stage">Inside the von Meer estate, the family of four gathers for a hearty breakfast. Erika and KJ fight over the eggs and sausage as Karl Senior stirs at his bowl of oatmeal and his wife, Pauline, stabs at a red grapefruit with her over-sized spoon.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Mouth full of eggs) Are we on for polo tomorrow, Kage?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Grabbing a slice of toast and slathering it with butter and jam) Sure are - but I still don't understand why we can't play today?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I have some tests to do at the lab</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I know you just started your job at SCU but please don't make it a habit of spending all of your time there - I just got my sister home, I'm not losing her to a bunch of eels or frat boys!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Downing her orange juice) What's the difference between the two?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No fair - you were in a sorority</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> For one year... and it was 12 months too long - don't worry, little brother, you still outrank the eels... for now</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Ha</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Grumbling) It would be nice if both of you started showing some interest in the family business - Douglas is grooming Griffin to take over - don't get me wrong, I like the boy, but I would prefer to have one of my own children, if not both, represent our half of Meeramar</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika turns to KJ and they play &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors.&quot; KJ wins with paper over a rock.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Damn</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Sorry, sis, the company belongs to you</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> It would be nice if Erika finally married poor Grif and this issue would become moot</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking up) Oh, I'm sorry mother, are you here?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Scowling at her daughter) I swear, if they had a degree beyond a doctorate, you would've hid yourself away for another two years - when in the hell are you finally going to grow up and become a woman?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> As soon as you stop wearing a pink mini tennis skirt</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> HA</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Hey, now</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Stuffing his mouth with a doughnut) Sorry</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Seriously, mother, how do you define the term &quot;woman&quot; - meaning I marry a man and reproduce, is that it?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> That's a step in the right direction!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE - for someone who rallied with Billie Jean King to get a professional women's tour started, you sound like you're still living in the 1890's!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> At least I'm living, I'm not traipsing around the globe to study seashells</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> NO, YOU TRAIPSED AROUND THE WORLD TO HIT A FUZZY BALL</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Does anyone know what the weather is going to be today?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Like it is 99% of the time here in California - mostly sunny, marine layer at night</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> I read that KCON is looking for a new weatherman - you should audition</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Dad, I just passed the bar - now is so not the time to tell me that you always wanted me to be a meteorologist!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Maybe you could've passed THAT test on the first try?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Throwing his napkin down) SHUDDUP, RIKKA</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> DO NOT TELL YOUR BROTHER TO SHUT UP AT THE TABLE</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Should I tell him on the patio instead?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> The old KCON weathergirl got promoted to a station in LA - I feel sorry for her - LA's not that great</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Oh, by the way KJ - Dr. Sanchez's wife is a tax attorney and she heads up some pro bono legal group for the poor - I told him that you would be more than happy to help her out on occasion</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> WHY DID YOU DO THAT?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Because... it's good for you, it's good for me, and it's good for society - hey, I made a rhyme!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Sighing) What's her name?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Onorita or Anna Rosa or something like that - just call the number and ask for &quot;Mrs. Sanchez&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> Are there any white people left in this town?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> No, mother, you scared them all away when you bent over in your pink mini</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> HA</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> DAD</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Sorry</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Jumping up) I think I need some antacid and it has NOTHING to do with what I just ate</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Also jumping up) I have to get to the lab</p>
 
<div class="stage">Father and son watch the two women exit the room and quietly return to their breakfast.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> The Cactus finally won a game</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Awesome!</p>


<bar></bar>


<div class="stage">Now at the SCU laboratory, Erika spends several hours doing her ordinary work while carefully conducting some covert tests. The last of her co-workers, Shelby Willis, finishes her studies and prepares to leave.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Looking up and smiling) All set, Shel?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Just about - I need to drop this in Sandy's box and off I go!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> How's Baby Cal doing?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> No longer a baby, I finally have him potty trained</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Measuring a beaker) Excellent</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> You are telling me - however, now I have to train him to put the seat down</p>
 
<div class="stage">The two chuckle.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Kage and I will be playing some polo tomorrow, you should come along</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Considering the offer) I haven't played since my days on the island</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Well then, you need to dust off your mallet and saddle up</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Smiling) I just might take you up on that - thank you</p>
 
<div class="stage">Oblivious to it all day, Erika now notices the date stamp on her computer. Shelby observes the sudden change of expression on her face.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> What happened, did the computer crash?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Softly) This is the 23rd?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Yes, why?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Um... nothing</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> It has to be something because you look like you were just visited by the spirit world</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> In a way, I was</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Near tears) It's the anniversary of my friend's death... three years to the day</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I am very sorry, Babygirl - you should not be here - you should be at the beach making an offering... or at least at home with your family</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Thanks, Shelby, but I feel at peace here - I really do</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Alright, if you say so</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Forcing a smile) I'll see you tomorrow</p>
 
<div class="stage">Watching the woman leave, Erika goes over to a locked refrigerator under her possession and removes a test tube containing a greenish liquid. She pours part of the contents into a beaker filled with a colorless mixture and begins to write in her lab book using the ancient Pali language.</div>
<div class="stage"><p>Erika's Journal</p>
 <blockquote>
 It is only appropriate that I conduct my first serious transmogrification on this date. I administered the injection with the re-sequencing serum to myself exactly 32 days ago, allowing more than enough time for my DNA to adapt. I shall now administer a small dose of what I can only call the &quot;fish cocktail&quot; to my hand as the initial testing area. Submersion in a tank of saltwater will provide the necessary catalyst. I expect the change to fall into a 5-10 minute parameter.
 </blockquote>
 </div>
<div class="stage">Now finished with her writing, Erika makes sure that all windows and doors are covered and locked. She takes one final breath and plunges her left hand into a tank of sea urchins. Nothing happens.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Swirling her hand around in the tank) DAMMIT, COME ON</p>
 
<div class="stage">Just about to give up, she starts to raise her hand out of the tank. Suddenly, a searing pain shoots through her entire body and her arm feels like it has caught on fire. Unable to deal with the anguish, she screams and flails wildly around the room, knocking over a chair. After a few moments, she is finally able to regain her composure. She looks down to see her newly changed arm.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Gasping) OH, DEAR GOD - I NEVER EXPECTED THIS</p>
 
<div class="stage">Frightened yet fascinated with what she sees before her, the pain dies down enough and she begins to wiggle her fingers. She touches the scales with her other hand in amazement and suddenly notices the fins protruding out of her forearm.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I... I don't believe it - I did it, I actually did it!</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/v14_erika_hand.jpg" width="440" height="482" border="0"></p>


<div class="stage">She scurries over to her lab book and continues to write notes when a forceful knock is heard at the door.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Hiding her hand behind her back) Yes?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Voice</span> Campus security, Dr. von Meer, is everything alright in there?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Just fine, thanks - there was a small accident but it's all cleaned up, nothing to worry about</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Voice</span> Are you sure, ma'am?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes... thank you!</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika waits several minutes but her hand has yet to return to its normal state.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I can't risk staying here - note to self - time to find a private lab somewhere</p>
 
<div class="stage">Folding her jacket over her arm, she carefully checks the halls and runs out of the SCU science complex. Now aboard her yacht, &quot;The White Tara,&quot; Erika sails out to a remote part of Duquesa Bay and drops anchor. Inside the cabin is a small gold statue given to her by her deceased friend.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/v14_white_tara.jpg" width="220" height="294" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Lighting several candles around it) Well, Sammy, not quite what I was expecting... heh, it's even better</p>
 
<div class="stage">Flushed and feverish, she gulps down a glass of ice water and pours the rest over her head.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Staring at her now normal hand) This will have far-reaching effects for the medical world... for the world in general - but, right now, I need it for the Nereidium - we can play morality and ethics later</p>
 
<div class="stage">Still unable to cool down, Erika strips off the remainder of her clothes and goes above deck. Beads of sweat drip from her forehead as she quickly dives into the cold, ocean water. The sudden rush of earlier takes place once again, this time, all over her body.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Unable to move) NO... THERE WASN'T... ENOUGH... TO DO... THIS</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika begins to choke on the water around her as she rapidly sinks below the surface. Waves of inner turmoil rock against the outer ones crashing against her trembling form.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Feeling her life fade) I... no... can't... Sammy... help</p>
 
<div class="stage">On the verge of blacking out, Erika notices a green sheen to her body. Suddenly, a jolt of power propels her forward. She now breaks the surface of the water with amazing speed. The dazed von Meer daughter climbs back aboard her ship, trying to comprehend the physical change that has transformed her in large patches.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Staring at her reflection) What... what am I?</p>
