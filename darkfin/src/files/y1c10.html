      <p>Erika ponders on her boat in the bay while Morrigan slowly adjusts to her KCON surroundings and co-workers. Information about the Celoso Beach murders, as well as a tasty basket of clams, is served at Captain Dave's Seafood Shack. Morrigan ends up at Santa Conchita University's Biology & Aquatics Department and asks Dr. Sanchez to run the sample for her. It ends up in the hands of Dr. von Meer.</p>

<div class="stage">Three miles off shore of Concha Dos, the middle island of the &quot;Las Islas Conchas&quot; trio in Duquesa Bay, Erika von
  Meer enjoys some alone time aboard her sailboat &quot;The White Tara.&quot; Stretching and sunning herself, she opens her
  lab book and begins to write in it, using the ancient Pali code.</div>

  <p>I believe I have found the reasons as to why it took time to complete the change back from the last transmogrification.
    If the simulations parallel the data I've collected, then morphing more than once in a 24 hour cycle should no longer
    be a problem. Further study is still required. However, if successful, my next goal will be to find a freshwater trigger.
    This will no longer limit me to saltwater submergence and will greatly increase my area of coverage. The major obstacle
    is not to change from a simple shower or a swim in the pool. I estimate the completion of this goal to be anywhere from
    3-6 months.</p>


  <p>Speaking of obstacles, Morrigan McBride continues to confound me. Why I spared her life, as well as the life of Anita Fiore,
    goes against my greater nature. Fiore can be easily handled, she lets her large ego get in the way of her small brain.
    McBride is the conundrum. A conundrum I will solve, one way or the other.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="stage">She closes her book, sits up, and dangles both legs over the side of the boat. Her feet dip into the deep, blue water where
    a school of Dorado swim around and nibble at her toes.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> I wish I could stay out here all day with you but I need to take these medical supplies to my lair - then
    I have to go back and teach a Bio 101 class to a bunch of morons who think picking their nose is a scientific study</p>

  <div class="stage">On the second floor of the KCON building, Morrigan sits inside her stark, gray, undecorated cubicle and stares at the computer
    screen.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Unaware that she is singing out loud) I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream...</p>

  <div class="stage">Gracie Takanachi quietly comes up behind her.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I cannot make a single sound as you scream</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Startled) HEY, don't ever sneak up on my like that, I don't appreciate it!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Take it down a notch, Morri - everything's cool, everything's serene!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sorry, I just don't like surprises</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Wow, are you ever in the wrong business</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To herself) And the wrong town</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> You, Chickie, have a gorgeous voice - USE IT MORE - the club I spin at has Karaoke Tuesdays, you could
    win some serious cash, as well as, plenty o' pints for your pals</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Returning to her computer) I'll keep that in mind</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> What has you so deep in thought... and singing, no less?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My... my story</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking over her shoulder) You've written two words</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I need to get it done</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> The school board thing, right?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Typing) Yeah</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hell, that'll take you a half hour at most</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> True... it's certainly not a multiple homicide or a train wreck, now is it?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Things have been pretty calm around here the last few days</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> THANK GOD</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Feel like lunch?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I feel like doing some research into those murders</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I know a way to do both - let me get my keys and we'll go</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do you mind if we stop off and pick up my car on the way? - it's finally ready</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> But are you ready for the bill?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing her purse) Never</p>

  <div class="stage">The two go over to Gracie's cube. It is adorned with twinkle lights, a bamboo plant, a fish bowl, a calendar of half-naked
    firemen, and a gigantic poster of Electra Woman &amp; Dyna Girl. Morrigan studies each item intently.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Noticing) OK, you've been in my space nearly a dozen times over the last three days - the fascination
    should be waning!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I just find it... interesting</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Try decorating your own &quot;office&quot; - you've been here long enough now and there isn't even a plant
    on your desk</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I like to keep my personal life at home and my professional life at the office - no trinkets, no pictures,
    no plants!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> One little cactus will not kill you</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> But I will most likely kill IT - plants always die on me, like everything else in my life</p>

  <div class="stage">Upon hearing this comment, Gracie playfully strides away from Morrigan as they walk through the halls. Jason Clark, a tall
    African-American man on crutches, hops over to them.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hi Jason</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> Where are you off to, ladies?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Captain Dave's for some fish 'n chips - want to come with?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> Sounds good but I have to be in the editing bay for the next hour - could you bring me back some?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Sure thing</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How's the ankle doing?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> Much better, thanks - are you learning your way around here yet?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Getting there</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> Don't worry, you will - I'll catch you two later</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Extra fries, right?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Jason</span> (Hopping off) You got it!</p>

  <div class="stage">The two petite women make their way to the KCON parking lot.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I like Jason, he's a cool guy - do you think he'd mind if I asked for his autograph? - my dad is a big
    college basketball fan and it would absolutely make his day</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Getting in the van) No, he won't mind at all - not everyone gets to make the game winning shot in the
    NCAA quarterfinals like he did</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Also getting in) Yes, but he probably wants to be seen as a sports reporter now</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Starting the engine) He'll still sign the autograph, trust me - so, what do you think about the rest
    of the crew?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Everyone has been really nice... Turner has exploited my train wreck situation as much as he could,
    so I don't see him anymore - I haven't seen much of Kylee, either</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Try looking in the stairwell or under Gates' desk</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I like Austin but if he asks me to do the &quot;weather dance&quot; with him one more time, I will kill
    Mr. Ortega... and I'm not a violent person</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Not yet</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh, and Dan calls me Sarah - is that because I mistakenly called him &quot;Don&quot; on my first day?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> No, he calls all the girls &quot;Sarah&quot; - it was the name of his favorite intern ... five years ago!
  </p>

  <div class="stage">Morrigan shoots Gracie a perplexed look.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> He can't remember ANYONE'S name - so, he calls us &quot;Sarah&quot; and the guys &quot;Buddy&quot;</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> oookayyy</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> What about Claudia?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Besides introducing ourselves, Claudia hasn't really chatted with me yet - I'm a little sad since she
    is a major role model of mine since my first journalism class in high school</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Snickering) Just what Claudia wants be reminded of - how old she is</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I met her husband, Benjamin, he seems like a sweetheart</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> He is - and the best damn dentist in town - the two of them as a couple are quite funny to watch</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Claudia keeps her husband's balls in a big old mason jar labeled with bold calligraphy &quot;MINE&quot;
    - if she weren't married to Ben, I'd swear she'd be the first in line to an Indigo Girls concert</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Really?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> But she's not, Anita tried once and got a huge bucket of ice dumped on her sorry ass</p>

  <div class="stage">The mental image causes Morrigan to chuckle.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> She and Ben are just like that, you know? - they like the role reversal - some men are happy cooking and
    cleaning while their women strut around like a roosters and slay the evil dragon</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's cool</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hey hey for them - they have a long, solid marriage and their kids are well-adjusted, nice people... so
    unlike the other Martels!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I like Dr. Stephanie</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Well, she finally wised up and ditched that family, she's back to being a Gates now... which is only a
    small improvement</p>

  <div class="stage">They arrive at the mechanic's and pick up Morrigan's car. She then follows Gracie along Via Royal to the Duquesa Bay Pier
    where they park and get out.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Starting to walk towards the pier) What are you waiting for, Gracie?</p>

  <img  b="0" h="200" w="319" src="assets/images/y1c10_wharf.jpg" alt="The Wharf" a="center"/>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Looking around) Zach - he called and said he'd meet us here for lunch</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You two are inseparable</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> We keep tabs on each other - neither of us wants to be scooped</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's LUNCH</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> IT'S WAR</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Winking) It's LOOOOOVE</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> WHAT? - ARE YOU WHACKED? - TAKE THAT BACK</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You LOVE him, Gracie Takanachi</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> YOU ARE INSANE, MORRIGAN MCBRIDE - THAT BLAST DID SOMETHING TO YOU</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My greatest gift, as well as my greatest curse, is the ability to read people - and I read Zachary &quot;Eyes&quot;
    Isaacson all over your heart and on your uterine walls</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> EEEEWWWW - THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY LUNCH</p>

  <div class="stage">Zach pulls up next to them in a beat-up, silver hatchback.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Getting out) Nice 'Stang, M&amp;M... can I ride your pony?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Evil grin) Other carousels await you, dear boy</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Huh?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I'M HUNGRY, LET'S EAT, NOW</p>

  <div class="stage">The three make their way towards Captain Dave's Seafood Shack on the pier.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> How's your car?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Fine now - the mechanic said he's never seen circuitry fried like that before</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Hmm</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> Weird</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Very</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Tell me, Lady McBride, what exactly does &quot;Penis My Tire&quot; mean?</p>

  <div class="stage">Both women stop and look at him.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Your license plate... PNSMYTR</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rolling her eyes) &quot;Pen Is Mightier&quot; you jerk!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> Ah</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> I like Zach's interpretation better</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Big surprise</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> What does that mean?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Running off) I GOT DIBS ON THE PINBALL MACHINE</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Zach</span> (Chasing after her) HEY, I ALWAYS GO FIRST</p>

  <div class="stage">All three enter the small restaurant through a side door. As Gracie and Zach entertain themselves with a game, Morrigan
    sits at a glazed wooden table and ponders the ocean from her window. A burly man with an auburn beard calls to her from
    behind the counter.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> Can I get you something, Miss?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Snapping out of her trance) Oh, I'm sorry</p>

  <div class="stage">Morrigan goes over to him.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> Hopefully, one day, I can afford an actual waitress</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> If you do, please don't make her wear a humiliating uniform made of seashells</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> How about starfish?</p>

  <div class="stage">The two share a quick laugh.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm guessing you're Captain Dave?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> Aye, aye - and you be?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Extending her hand) Morrigan McBride</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> (Shaking it) Right, the dog saver - what can I get you?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll have an order of fried clams, a side of slaw, iced tea... and some information, please</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> I can help you with the first three, I'm not so sure about the last request</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Gracie said you might know about the men who washed ashore on Celoso Beach?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> I didn't know them personally - but they're friends of a friend, that kind of thing - all of the
    local fishermen are taking up a collection to help the families out</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's very generous</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> (Handing her a basket of clams) I know they were doing something illegal at the time but you can't
    blame the families for their actions - everyone deserves a proper burial</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Sprinkling malt vinegar on her clams) Do you think you could arrange a meeting between me and one of
    the family members?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> You seem like a nice gal, Ms. McBride, but they don't need to deal with media vultures right now</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Look, I know how it is to lose someone you love - I just want to get a little information to figure
    this out so it won't happen again</p>

  <div class="stage">The large man considers this for a moment as Morrigan quietly eats her clams.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> (Looking over to the pinball machine) You leave Fingers and Eyes behind and I'll see what I can
    do
  </p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It will just be me, one on one - no cameras, I promise!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> Give me a number where I can reach you</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Writing her number on a napkin) Thank you - oh, one more thing...</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> Would you like some tartar sauce?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I would like to know about Aleta Oscura</p>

  <div class="stage">Turning pale, Captain Dave looks around and motions for Morrigan to follow him into the kitchen.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> What do you know about her?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Her... so, it is definitely female?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> (Clearing the sink) The guys who have seen her say she has a nice pair of jugs</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Back up weapons, I'm sure</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> (Serious) You think?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How long has she been here?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> There has been more and more talk about her over the last few months but sightings and stories about
    Darkfin... her ENGLISH name... have been around for years</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do you remember when they first started exactly?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> (Laying out his catch of the morning on the table) Not real sure but I'll ask around</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'd appreciate that</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> (Taking out a fillet knife) You know, I agree with Darkfin's environmental concerns - no one likes
    a dirty hypo in their chowder - but she didn't have to kill those men, she could've disabled their boat, called the authorities,
    whatever - now, there are two widows and four kids without dads</p>

  <div class="stage">With one swift move, he chops off the heads of two fish as Morrigan turns away.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Captain Dave</span> I just don't believe in killing</p>

    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hey, you two, I have some errands to run - Gracie, I'll meet you back at the station and Zach, try reading
    Edward Bulwer Lytton sometime</p>

  <div class="stage">Within moments, Morrigan arrives at Santa Conchita University. She walks across the campus and enters a hall leading her
    to the Biology &amp; Aquatics Department. She catches Dr. Javier Sanchez on his way to class.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Dr. Sanchez, may I have a moment of your time?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> The new KCON reporter, correct? - it is lovely to finally meet you - we had an amazing weekend, did we
    not?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You could say that</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Smoothing his hair back) Are you here to interview me?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh, not right now - actually, I'm here to ask you a favor</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Disappointed) Of course, what do you need?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pulling out one plastic baggie with the Q-Tip inside) I was hoping you could run some tests on this
    and tell me exactly what it is</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Glancing at the contents) Where did you get the sample from?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Actually, I found it on the bumper of my trailer</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Looking at his watch) Interesting - I shall run some tests and have the results for you tomorrow - right
    now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get to class</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you, Dr. Sanchez</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Gently squeezing her hand) Please, call me Sandy... and let me know when you'd like to set up an interview</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Forced smile) Certainly</p>

  <hr>

  <div class="stage">Later, after his class, Sandy encounters Dr. Shelby Willis in the hall.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> Shel... do me a favor</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Oh no</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Taking Morrigan's sample out of his pocket) Please</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> NO NO NO - Javier Sanchez, I am NOT doing your work for you!</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> Look, I have to be at a meeting with all of the other department heads in a few minutes, I don't have
    time to do this myself</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Find the time - just like the rest of us - I have to pick up Calvin from school and get ready for the
    Feast of Orunmila tonight</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> It's a favor to KCON, we need them for good PR</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Shelby</span> Sandy, I told you once, and now I am telling you a second time - I am NOT doing it - Erika is in the lab,
    have HER do it for you... good-bye!</p>

  <div class="stage">Taking Shelby's suggestion, Sandy finds Erika working in the lab and cautiously approaches her.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> Doing something that requires your immediate attention?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Not looking up) Let me guess, you have something to do, you asked Shelby to do it for you, she turned
    you down, and now you're asking me</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> No, not at all... well, yes, maybe - could you?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> What is it?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> (Placing the baggie on the counter) Just a sample that needs to be run</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Still working on her project) What kind of sample?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> That's the question, I'm not sure what it is</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Tim is due in pretty soon, I'll have him test it</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> As long as it's done by tomorrow, muchas gracias!</p>

  <div class="stage">As Sandy turns to leave, Erika finally glances at the sample and is immediately intrigued by it.</div>

  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> Wait, where did you get this?</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Javier</span> That new KCON reporter brought it over... I think her name is Maureen</p>
  <p class="line">
    <span class="actor">Erika</span> (Clenching her teeth) Morrigan... Morrigan McBride</p>
