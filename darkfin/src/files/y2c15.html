      <h2>Awash</h2>

<div class="stage">Alone and chanting, the white-robed head of The Clergy is suddenly interrupted by two underlings in blue robes. The two stand by a cavern wall as their leader effortlessly floats down from a ledge to their level.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Your report</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> Our mission was successful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Has the priest transcended?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> Violently</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Excellent - and McBride?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> The prime suspect</p>

<div class="stage">The white-robed leader clasps its hands in glee and paces around the dark, sandy floor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> So, everything went according to plan</p>

<div class="stage">The two in the blue robes look at each other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Noticing them) Did it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> (Hesitant) Yes...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> Except for one minor glitch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Voice lowering an octave) GLITCH?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> Morrigan was indeed lured to Saint Brendan's</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> That has already been established</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> Unfortunately, she never actually set foot inside the church itself, she was outside in the parking lot and then abruptly left</p>

<div class="stage">A growl of displeasure is heard from the leader.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> (Nervous) It... it was as if she was warned somehow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> BY WHOM?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> (Taking a step back) That, we do not know</p>

<div class="stage">The leader only answers with an enraged release of breath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> But we will find out, I can assure you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> Morrigan was feeling ill, I believe her leaving so suddenly was legitimate in nature</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Approaching Blue Two) For both of your sakes, you better hope that this is true</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> The objective was met, Master</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Maybe... but it will be more difficult to prove the Marked One's guilt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> I am fully confident in that we will be able to amend this matter and her guilt will be unquestionable</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Make sure that it is - has she been in contact with The Other yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> No, but we are certain that they will meet up again soon, especially after the circumstances of this evening</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> We have subordinates keeping watch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> She must not leave with her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue One</span> How... how can we prevent that? - Aleta Oscura is most skilled, the last few times...</p>

<div class="stage">Suddenly, Blue One is hurled across the way and slammed up against a stone surface by the simple wave of the leader's hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> I AM WELL AWARE OF THE LAST FEW TIMES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> (Taking two more steps back) We are just wondering if we are allowed to prevent The Other from taking her by any means necessary?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Grabbing Blue Two by the throat and choking him) NO, we need them separated but we need them both alive - IS THAT CONCISE ENOUGH FOR YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Two</span> (Gasping) Yes... of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Throwing him down next to the other) It better be or the next &quot;glitch&quot; will be at the base of your brain stem</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Arriving at Duquesa Bay's Harbor Town, KJ pulls over his Porsche and Erika jumps out of the back seat after saying a quick &quot;goodnight&quot; to her brother and Ms. McBride. Watching the blonde run into the distance, KJ takes off down the highway.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c15_kj.jpg" h="348" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Glancing at Morrigan) Are you OK?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking out at the water) I don't understand why we left your sister off in the middle of Harbor Town?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Her boat is docked at the marina</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> She should be at a hospital for that cut over her eye</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> She doesn't really care for doctors</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> But she's a scientist?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Heh, exactly - listen, she probably has some magic kelp cure or whatever brewing up in the SCU lab for that eye</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's a little creepy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> It's her job - pharmaceutical companies are constantly banging at her door for the next big wonder drug - there's great hope in the ocean</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Right - when we're done plundering the rainforests, we can turn our attentions there!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> It's called progress</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Tell THAT to the Dodo bird</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I spoke to Griffin earlier and he's cool about the car</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan raises an eyebrow at a smirking KJ and the two chuckle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Very funny, but I'm still worried about your sister - the way my luck is running tonight, I don't need her blinded by my poor driving</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> One thing I've learned since the age of four is that Erika generally knows how to take care of herself - you really don't need to worry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I suppose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Taking Morrigan's hand) I am more worried about you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Snippy) Are you saying I can't take care of myself?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No, not at all - it's just that you fell into some serious shit here tonight, Morri, and I'm afraid it's going to get worse</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, count on it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm being set up because of a story I'm pursuing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> What's it about?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I can't say... not yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> OH, C'MON HERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sorry, KJ, but it's just too important and I'm not going to risk it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> You do realize what you're facing here? - Murder One of a beloved priest in a state that has the death penalty - can it be any clearer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> My story has more riding on it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Doing a double take) YOU'RE FREAKING SERIOUS - unless it's about space aliens firing death rays at our nation's capital, I don't think so!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Recognizing a beach she met Darkfin at before) Pull over</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> WHAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> PULL OVER, I want to walk the rest of the way home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> NO, NO WAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll be fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Speeding up) NOPE, I'm trying to be understanding here but I will most certainly NOT let you go running off alone into the night after what happened earlier</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I said I will be fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Isn't that what you said before you went to St. B's?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan scowls at KJ and sighs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Do you WANT your body to be found floating in the bay, is that it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Realizing it would be easier for her to come back later) I appreciate your concern, I really do... I guess I should go home and get some rest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Kissing her on the cheek) I lo... um, I really care about you, Morrigan - deeply - and I don't want anything to happen to you - if I wasn't such a dolt tonight at the pizza parlor, maybe none of this would be happening right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Returning the kiss to his cheek) Don't you dare blame yourself for my actions, KJ, I had to go to Saint Brendan's tonight regardless of what happened</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I wish I could tell you, I honestly do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Rubbing his face) OK, if you won't tell me, would you at least tell your lawyer? - I'm not a criminal attorney but I know the best ones in town... you'll meet with them tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I can't afford...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Holding his hand up) DAMMIT, MORRI, if you won't trust me with your story, would you at least trust me with this... please?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Smiling) Thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Squeezing her hand) We're going to beat this, I promise!</p>

<div class="stage">The two finally arrive back at her house on Willowbrook and park in the driveway. KJ gets out and checks around the house as Morrigan goes up to her front door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Once the media finds out about you, it's going to get ugly here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have no doubt that it will</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Pack up a few things, you can stay with me at the house</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yeah, that will really endear me to your family</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Dad already adores you, Rikka is never around, and mom would find fault with Mother Teresa living with us, so don't worry about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Again, I am moved by your overwhelming generosity but I'm not dragging you into this mess anymore than I already have - if something happened to your sister or your folks... or you because of this, I could never live with myself - besides, it would look like I was hiding - I did nothing wrong, there's no reason for me to hide</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Ominous tone) Oh, I think there is</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan is alarmed by his voice.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Whoever is after you won't stop - if you won't stay at the house, at least consider my suite at the Del Pilar</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'll think about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Gently approaching her) Seriously?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Flirtatious) I'll... think... about it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Bending in) We could go there now, if you'd like</p>

<div class="stage">Before she has a chance to respond, KJ begins to kiss her. Reluctant at first but in need of comfort, Morrigan takes him into her arms and they start to make out. As they back up against the porch wall, a sudden image of Darkfin battling the hooded figures flashes across her mind.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Breaking off) Uh... this is nice but I need some air</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Do you want me to stay the night?</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan looks at him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I'll sleep on the couch, of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks, but I really need some time alone to try to sort out everything that's happened</p>

<div class="stage">Picking up on his disappointment and not looking to get into another discussion, Morrigan goes over to him and kisses him sweetly several times.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking his hands in hers) Swing by in the morning and I'll make you some of my famous blueberry waffles?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Nuzzling her nose) Deal - are you sure you'll be alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Unlocking her door and going inside) Yep</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I'll have Meeramar security guards stationed in front of your house</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> It's no problem, really... LOCK YOUR DOOR</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Doing so) Thanks - goodnight!</p>

<div class="stage">She watches him as he slowly walks back to his car. KJ takes one more look around, waves to Morrigan in the window, and then leaves.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I should be making love to him right now, what is wrong with me?</p>

<div class="stage">A voice from in back startles Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Voice</span> You have too much on your mind</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Flipping on the lights) JESUS, AMY, YOU SCARED THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME</p>

<div class="stage">Amethyst Hill is quietly sitting at Morrigan's kitchen table with her cat in her arms.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What are you doing here... check that, what are you doing IN here?</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c15_amy.jpg" h="475" w="320"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Serious expression) Roshumba was very worried about you, there was something malevolent in the air tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You can say that again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Patting her cat) When you did not answer your door or your phone, I let myself in to wait for you... and to do a cleansing of your rooms with sage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I thought it smelled like fresh potpourri in here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Well, I saw a bad movie, ate some bad pizza... oh, and I was framed for killing a priest!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Jumping up) You need to have your runes read RIGHT NOW to figure out what's coming next!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> In all honesty, I don't really want to know what's coming next</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan goes over to her front door and opens it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I appreciate your concern, Amy, but I seriously need to pee and then get some sleep... you can read my runes tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Taking the hint) Fine, Roshumba and I will be back at dawn... and be sure to light that amber candle I left by your bedside</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) Thanks - oh, and be prepared for hordes of media vultures trampling your lawn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Winking and closing the door behind her) No problem, I'll just add it to your rent!</p>

<div class="stage">Finally alone, Morrigan rushes to the bathroom and then changes into a swimsuit and sweats. She spots the blinking light on her machine and plays her messages back. Zach and Gracie leave long, rambling supportive messages.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's sweet of them - I wonder if they'll stay that sweet when things get really hideous?</p>

<div class="stage">There is a message from her KCON boss.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Turner</span> McBride - you are officially on suspension - don't bother coming into work until this garbage is cleaned up!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sure Kylee is thrilled</p>

<div class="stage">There is one more message on the machine but, for some reason, it won't play.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Skipping it) Whatever!</p>

<div class="stage">Digging out her notepad, she calls Joenne Mirabello's number and leaves a message.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Curt) Find a time for us to meet tomorrow and call me back</p>

<div class="stage">As she is about to head out the side entrance, Morrigan pauses, zips over to her room, lights the candle, and then heads off towards the beach.</div>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Back at the Fiore farmhouse, Anita goes over the events of the evening with her parents and uncle as Craig offers his support.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Are you sure about your story, dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Banging his hand on the table) I don't know how many more times I have to explain it to you, girl - Father Greg was shot, I went outside, there was the gun, Padre Juan was with me when I picked it up - THE END</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Shrugging his shoulders) A priest backing up your father's story - you can't ask for a better witness</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Maybe, but you can't escape the fact that dad's prints are now on the murder weapon - someone with power and money can easily twist it around to make him look guilty</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Scoffing) You don't have to tell me that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Aside to Anita) But your father's stroke, he doesn't have the strength, anyone can see that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> My father is still an expert hunter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> With a rifle - a handgun is an entirely different matter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Try explaining that to novice jurors</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Why would someone want to go after my Frank when the police already have Morrigan McBride? - she admitted to it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> No... she only admitted that it was her gun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Aghast) Are you standing up for this she-devil?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Anita is right - I think someone is trying to get to her because of the story</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Waving her hand in disgust) AY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> What story?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I called Morrigan over to the church tonight - I wanted her to meet your mother as a source</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> What kind of source?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> She wants to do a piece on the ancient burial grounds</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> And why would someone try to stop her from doing that when even the freaking high school newspaper has done a story on it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I don't know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> McBride couldn't have killed Father Greg - anyone who risks their life to save a dog certainly doesn't have it in them to kill a man of the cloth!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Don't be so quick to judge, Francisco, just because she has a kind face</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> And a nice ass, too</p>

<div class="stage">Frank, Craig, and Hector cackle as Carmen storms into the kitchen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Glaring at her uncle) HEY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> What? - I was just waiting for you to say it, Anita</p>

<div class="stage">Ona Rosa's car speeds up the driveway.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Ah, good, the relief is here!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Rushing inside) Where's mom? - DAD - my God, tell me everything that happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Pouring himself a drink) NOT AGAIN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Where's Sandy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Hugging her father) With the kids - I don't understand what's going on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Slipping on her jacket) Ma and Tio will fill you in - c'mon Captain, we need to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Where?</p>

<div class="stage">Anita stares him down.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> See you all later!</p>

<div class="stage">The two amble off towards Anita's car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Care to fill me in, Lieutenant?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Time for a little night fishing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> ARE YOU SERIOUS? - NOW?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> McBride is a lot of things but she is not a killer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> So?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I bet I know exactly where she's at right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Pondering for a second) You think?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> She'd be the first one I'd turn to if I were in this dung pile</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Now at the remote beach she passed by earlier in KJ's car, Morrigan strips off her sweats and goes for a swim just past the breakwater.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Searching in the distance) Dammit, where are you - I really need to talk to you!</p>

<div class="stage">Minutes pass by with nothing happening. Morrigan decides to head back to shore. Suddenly, two green arms grab around her waist and direct her towards a jetty.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Perching herself on a rock) I WISH you would give me some kind of warning</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Joining her) I did... your human ears could not detect it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You... you could have been a shark</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Yes, I could have been - it was most unwise of you to swim out here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I needed to see you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You know? - HOW do you know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I just do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Throwing her face into her hands) UGH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Why do you need to see me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (On the verge of tears) I'm in serious trouble... and I have no idea how to save my ass this time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Reluctantly wrapping her arm around Morrigan's shoulder) Tell me everything</p>

<div class="stage">Now sobbing, Morrigan returns the gesture with a desperate hug and recounts the earlier events of the evening. Darkfin senses that they are being observed from afar but does not say or do anything to frighten the already upset woman.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c15_morri_df_sea.jpg" h="631" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (On the verge of tears) I mean, this is like a chess match and I can barely hold my own at checkers!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I will be here to assist you in all matters</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Um, it looks like Kylee Shepperton will be taking over the story I started on the Chumash Burial grounds</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Angered) SHE CANNOT HANDLE IT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> SHE'LL HAVE TO WHEN I'M PUT IN PRISON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I will not let this situation get that far</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Are you going to risk exposing yourself to save me?</p>

<div class="stage">At first, Darkfin turns away and does not respond.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Trust me... I will figure it out</p>
