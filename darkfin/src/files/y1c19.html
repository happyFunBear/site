<div class="stage">Inside the main, marble lobby of the Meer-A-Mar corporate headquarters, the press gathers for a statement about the events that took place on one of the company's ships four nights ago. Karl von Meer Sr. frantically dials his cell phone as Doug Martel watches his son, Griffin, approach the podium.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/meer-a-mar_plaque.jpg" h="96" w="269"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Into the phone) Dammit, KJ, where are you? - this is important, can't you get out of court for once? - no, I don't know where Erika is... it sure would be nice if at least ONE of my children gave a damn about our family's interests!</p>

<div class="stage">Sighing, Karl Sr. pockets the phone as Doug pats him on the back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Relax, old man, Griff will take care of this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> That's what I'm afraid of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> At least he's here - that's more than I can say for your two</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/griffin_headshot.gif" h="237" w="192"  b="0" a="center"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Speaking into the mike) Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for coming - I will issue a brief statement and then take a few of your questions... last Thursday night, two gruesome discoveries were made aboard &quot;The Maleeva&quot; a Meer-A-Mar Industries tanker based out of the Black Sea - one, it was carrying an illegal arms shipment and two, the crew was viciously attacked by an unknown assailant - we are currently cooperating with the United States Coast Guard, as well as several local and international law enforcement agencies to remedy this situation... </p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Watching the women in the room watch Griffin) The ladies all used to look at me like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Rolling his eyes) Yes, I remember the academy very well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> It wasn't just the academy... what I can't figure out is when exactly did it stop?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Maybe when you got married... again - and your wife, who is comparable in age to your daughter, gave birth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Funny, I don't feel any different - I see my son up there right now, he has my looks, my charm, he IS me... except a few decades younger</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> We're all getting older, Douglas, learn to accept it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I don't want to, I still feel 30!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Weren't you telling me earlier about how you get leg cramps whenever you ride your Harley?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Grimacing) I still feel 30 mentally</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> You should be happy with what you have accomplished with your life, most men would kill for a quarter of what you have</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> It doesn't seem like enough</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> In conclusion, Meer-A-Mar had no prior knowledge of this cargo - an internal investigation into this matter has been launched and we will promptly deal with anyone involved - the authorities and the media will be kept apprised of our findings, thank you...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (To Karl Sr.) Ursula wants me to have liposuction</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Martel, we are in the middle of a crisis here!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> This is not a crisis - a crisis would be a shipment full of mutilated babies</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Shaking his head) I can't believe you just said that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> It's the truth - this is an incident at best and tomorrow it will be a forgotten memory - it's the glory of the fast-paced society we live in now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> We have four dead men and several others severely injured</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Gun-running Bulgarians, who cares?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Their families?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Griffin has already made arrangements for a generous settlement - even though we are NOT at fault</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> He seems to have everything under control</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> He better!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking out over the reporters) I'll take a few questions now... Ms. Shepperton</p>

<div class="stage">The KCON reporter and weekend anchor stands and gives a soft smile.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Aside to Karl Sr.) You know, Erika better watch out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I mean that Kylee Shepperton is real competition for Griffin's affections</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Ah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I absolutely cannot understand why Erika keeps him at bay?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (To himself) Because my daughter is smart</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y1c19_kylee_newsgirl.jpg" h="321" w="270"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> Mr. Martel, there are allegations that this was the work of a vigilante - is this true?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I will defer to the proper authorities on that subject... next question</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Whispering) There's talk among the crew that it was that she-creature again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Oh, for heaven's sake, you don't believe that garbage, do you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I don't know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> C'mon, Doug - next thing you'll be telling me is that the Loch Ness monster just bought a summer home off of Beacon Point and that Big Foot is applying for a job on the loading docks!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> All I'm saying, Karl, is that I don't rule it out - I've seen too much in my life to ever rule anything out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> You've been watching too much of your wife's crazy TV show</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Glancing at his watch and taking off) Speaking of which, I promised to meet her for lunch</p>

<div class="stage">As the press conference disperses, Griffin comes over to Karl Sr.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Where's my father?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> He took off for lunch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking down) Oh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Patting the man on the back) You did a fine job, Griffin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Thank you - tell me, have you heard from Erika today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> No, I haven't seen her since Thursday - KJ said she went for a sail</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Searching the room) Where is Kage?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Clenching his jaw) Not here</p>

<div class="stage">The elder von Meer heads back to his office as Kylee struts up to Griffin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> May I buy you some coffee, Ms. Shepperton?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kylee</span> (Smiling) Don't you have a cappuccino machine in your office?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Let's find out</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Sprawled on a blue and white couch with Tallulah the tarantula on her stomach, Morrigan watches the press conference on TV. She casually answers the ringing phone on the wicker table beside her.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y1c19_talula.gif" h="80" w="82"  b="0" a="center"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Still watching the TV) Hello, Gracie - yes, Gracie - I saw the whole thing, Gracie - no, Gracie, this is my day off - I just got in from Dallas two hours ago - alright, Gracie - yes, she is a slut - I'll see you tomorrow - goodbye, Gracie!</p>

<div class="stage">The diminutive brunette puts the phone back with one hand as she carefully strokes the spider with the other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (To Tallulah) That was Crazy Gracie - you'll meet her soon enough - that guy in the lower right corner of the screen picking his nose during the press conference was Zach - they're both very weird but very nice - the KCON reporter covering it, that was Kylee, yes, THE Kylee... and I don't really think she's a slut, I think she thoroughly enjoys what she does - Gracie is insanely jealous of her... I suppose I can understand her POV - Zach is just pissed he can't get her into bed, thus their communal hatred for all things Shepperton</p>

<div class="stage">McBride reaches over for the newspaper and points to a picture of Captain Phelps and Lieutenant Fiore.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Here are Chip n' Dale, aka &quot;Captain Crunch&quot; and the &quot;Tuna Taster&quot; - whenever I see them in their uniforms, I want to break out into Village People songs, I'm not sure why - they're doing their damnedest to keep me in the dark... ha... about Darkfin, but they can't do it much longer - you can strain freaking ziti with their account of what happened aboard the Maleeva - and I would've pressed them on it too, but I had to rescue YOU... yes, I did, I had to come get my Lil Lu from evil Auntie before she got fed up and flushed you!</p>

<div class="stage">Springing off the couch, Morrigan carries Tallulah on her arm and puts a Tori Amos CD in her stereo.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Dancing around and singing)</p>
<blockquote>

<p><i>Talula<br>
 Talula<br>
 I don't want to lose it<br>
 It must be worth losing<br>
 If it is worth something<br>
 Talula<br>
 Talula<br>
 She's brand new now to you<br>
 Wrapped in your papoose<br>
 Your little Fig Newton</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="stage">After putting her pet back in the terrarium, Morrigan peers at it through the glass.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I hope you like your new home... I hope I like my new home - it's strange, part of me didn't want to come back here yet there was a bigger part of me that did</p>

<div class="stage">She resumes twirling around the room, singing along with the music.</div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>And Jamaica<br>
 Do you know, do you know what I have done<br>
 Mary M weaving on said<br>
 What you want is in the blood Senators<br>
 Said what you want is in the blood Senators, yes<br>
 I got Big Bird on the fishing line<br>
 With a bit of a shout a bit of a shout<br>
 A bit of an angry snout<br>
 He's my favorite hooker of the whole bunch<br>
</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="stage">There is a loud, persistent banging at her front door.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y1c19_amy_at_war.jpg" h="430" w="320"  b="0" a="center"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Halting) ARGH</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan throws it open to find Amethyst standing there wearing pink kitchen gloves, ski goggles and a &quot;Love Animals, Don't Eat Them&quot; apron. She's holding a giant spatula in one hand and a can of Raid in the other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Um, thanks Amy, I've already had lunch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> NO WAY, MORRI</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How about dinner?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> NO WAY IS THAT THING STAYING HERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying to look innocent) What thing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Pushing past her) THAT THING WITH EIGHT HAIRY LEGS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's just a little spider</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> LITTLE? - IF YOU CONSIDER THAT LITTLE, I WOULD HATE TO BE YOUR BOYFRIEND</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Keeping between the woman and the tarantula) You said I could have pets</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> PETS as in CATS and DOGS, maybe a ferret, but not that THING</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> C'mon, Amy, you of all people should be cool with this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Spying the spider and striking a karate pose) What does that supposed to mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> You can't kill, you're a Buddhist</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> But I can accidentally maim</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Look, I'll throw in an extra $10.00 a month on the rent</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I cannot be bought</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> $15.00?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Well...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And I think you should know that Tallulah is a Gemini... with Aries rising</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Relaxing) OH MY GODS, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO BEFORE?</p>

<div class="stage">She goes over to the terrarium and smiles at the spider as Morrigan rolls her eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Of course she can stay - you know, I can see she has the demeanor of an Aries rising</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do I still have to pay the extra $10.00 a month?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> $15.00 and I can't be held responsible if Roshumba decides she's snack material - sorry to interrupt your shower by the way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Baffled) Do I appear wet and unclothed to you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Cocking her head) I was wondering how you could properly bathe like that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Amy... TRY, TRY to make sense</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I heard you singing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You mean you weren't singing in the shower?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Motioning to her clothes) Nnnnno</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Euterpe lives!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> You have a musical gift, why do you shun it?</p>

<div class="stage">Tim Hajanian pokes his head in the door and gawks at Amethyst.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Um, excuse me... Morrigan?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh, hello, Tim - thanks for coming over</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I have the... ahem... information you requested</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Taking off her goggles and looking at Tim) Do you know Leon Serna?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Yes, we used to date</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> I used to cut his hair</p>

<div class="stage">There is an awkward silence as all three stare at each other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> OK, time for me to return to my universe - Morri, from now on, please be up front with me - I don't want to find a pet alligator in my jacuzzi!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Watching the woman leave) Damn, there goes your birthday surprise!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Looking uncomfortable as he hands over some documents) Here are your results</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I see a lot of charts and graphs, charts and graphs give me a headache - what's the bottom line?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Smelt innards</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Throwing the papers across the room) LIAR</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I am NOT lying - instead of tossing the results in the air like an insolent child and accusing me of not telling the truth, try LISTENING to what I have to say - isn't that what journalists are trained to do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Then say what you have to say, Mr. Hajanian</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Smelt innards are just the beginning - these results show a DNA cocktail of multiple varieties of marine life - we're talking rajiformes, lamniformes, anguilliforms, cephalopods...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hold on, hold on, hold on - I don't know what you're talking about!</p>

<div class="stage">Tim folds his arms and shakes his head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> See, in my biology class, I was busy doing the jocks' English homework so they wouldn't beat up the science geeks - in return, the science geeks did my biology homework - so, you're going to have to explain to me what you just said... in English</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I'm sorry, I left my ichthyology coloring books back at the office</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing a white lace doily off of the table and waving it) TRUCE - let's end the verbal exchanges, I know we both have better things to do with our time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I agree - simply stated, we have a mixture of DNA from rays, sharks, eels, octopuses, and several kinds of fish</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I thought it was octopi?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Blinking) It can be either</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> You don't really seem all that stunned by this news - tell me, is it because of your scientific stupidity or do you know something more about this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Is there human DNA in there as well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Yes, she is most definitely human</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> She...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> Another thing - all humans have certain metals in their blood... iron, cobalt, manganese - although this is not my area of expertise, there is a metal in this sample that I cannot even begin to comprehend</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> This keeps getting better and better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> I can't really explain anything else beyond this... and I am not so sure I want to - if that will be all then?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you, Tim</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Tim</span> (Leaving) Please keep your part of the agreement about George</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And please keep everything we discussed here today to yourself</p>

<div class="stage">The two exchange a final look before he departs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Rubbing her head) Research time</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside a small corner of the Santa Conchita University library, Erika sits at a table piled with old books and maps of the area's history.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y1c19_erika_research.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Rubbing her head) There has to be some real answers somewhere - I've had enough of this folklore and hocus pocus junk</p>

<div class="stage">As she slams the book closed, a voice echoes in back of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Sometimes folklore and hocus pocus junk can be better than a Venn Diagram</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Jumping out of her skin) JESUS, SHEL - don't creep up on me like that - what are you doing here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> Picking up some books for Calvin - what are YOU doing in this section?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Looking some stuff up for Penny, she's not doing well in her history class</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> What class is she doing well in? - listen, I have to go - promise me that you will get your face out of ALL books tonight and do something fun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Did Griffin, Sandy or my family pay you to say that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> (Squeezing Erika's shoulder) No one had to pay me to say that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Thanks Shel, I'll see you tomorrow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Shelby</span> I'll help you with the Gumberson paper then</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Under her breath) I wish you could help me with something more important...</p>

<div class="stage">As she gathers her books off of the table and crosses the room to another section, Erika suddenly notices Morrigan searching the books in the biology section.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Flipping through the pages of a technical manual) Maybe I should've started in the kids' section first</p>

<div class="stage">As she reaches another shelf, the eyes of Erika stare back at Morrigan.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Frozen in fear for a second and then becoming pissed) Please don't do that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Need some help?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, I'm fine, thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Glancing at the textbook) The mitochondrial protein sequences of Isurus oxyrinchus... is KCON trying to drive down ratings again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It's not for KCON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Oh?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Glancing at Erika's books) The subterranean geography of the Kiyomis - I'm going hiking there tomorrow with your brother, would you like me to bring back some brochures from the ranger?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That's an interesting place to hike - did KJ recommend it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Actually, it was Joenne Mirabello</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Hmm, she doesn't strike me as the hiking type</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And you don't strike me as the scientific type, so much for judging a book by its cover - speaking of which, I need to return to my research... please don't let me keep you from yours</p>

<div class="stage">The tall von Meer daughter flashes a cold, semi-smile and starts to walk off. She abruptly stops and turns back to McBride.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Nodding at her textbook) If you're curious to learn more about this subject, don't be afraid to ask</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Feeling the hairs on the back of her neck prickle) I shall keep that in mind</p>
