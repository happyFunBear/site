<div class="stage">At the USCG base, Captain Craig Phelps gawks in disbelief 
 at the erupting Mt. Wiggins in the distance. Lieutenant Anita Fiore 
 speeds up the road and stops just short of him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> (Jumping out of her car) Do you believe this, do you 
 fucking believe this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Kilauea put on these kinds of shows when I was stationed 
 in Hawaii - that was expected - this... this is totally unexpected</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> No, I'm talking about the Coast Guard forcing us back 
 on the active roster after treating us like perros.</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Simply focus on the hazardous duty pay</p>

<div class="stage">Anita kicks at the ground as they hurry over to a helicopter 
 and climb inside.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> (Preparing for take off) We get slammed in front of 
 the admiral for something we had no control over...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Anita</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> They dock our pay, plant our asses at a desk off base...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Don't rehash this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> But now, NOW they order us to return when all hell breaks 
 loose, literally</p>

<div class="stage">Craig sighs and rubs his face.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> (Mimicking voice) It's your duty in a time of crisis</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> We need you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> LIEUTENANT FIORE, THAT IS ENOUGH</p>

<div class="stage">Anita looks at Craig with a silent response.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> We have a job to do</p>

<div class="stage">They lift off into the air. There is uncomfortable tension 
 between them as they fly over the Santa Conchita Valley. Anita mutters 
 something to herself in Spanish.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Hey, I know exactly how you feel - who is riding shotgun 
 with you throughout this mess?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> I just can't believe they let us back into another bird 
 after WE supposedly were the responsible party for toasting the last 
 one</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> People's lives are at risk right now... the whole valley 
 is at risk right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> So, what in the hell are we doing up here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Following orders</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> YAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> TO DO WHAT WE CAN - we need to coordinate with officials 
 on how best to assess the situation and assist wherever we are needed 
 - understood?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Claro!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Besides... this is probably the best place to be right 
 now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> I told my folks to grab what they needed and hightail 
 it up the coast... but the really weird thing is that papi was already 
 in tears before all this went down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> I have no clue - ma came home with him from her monthly 
 heritage meeting and both of them were deeply upset over something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Probably bake sale issues - is Ona Rosa safe?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Yeah, yeah, she and the kids were at the church - DAMMIT, 
 the frequencies are all screwed tonight, I can barely get a channel 
 open!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Head southwest towards sector twelve</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Copy that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> (Still staring at the active volcano) Amazing, absolutely 
 amazing - OW</p>

<div class="stage">Craig grabs his head in pain.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> You okay?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> I'm still dealing with a nasty headache, not to mention 
 a case of nerves... our last ride up wasn't exactly a barrel of laughs</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> My wrist is still throbbing, of course it didn't help 
 throwing a punch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Let me guess... was Marcy somehow involved?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Somehow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Hmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Shall we talk about Ursula now or the impending destruction 
 of Duquesa Bay?</p>

<div class="stage">Craig flashes her a sideways glance.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> You are an excellent actress, Fiore - if we do get discharged, 
 you really ought to ask your girlfriend for a part... that is, if we're 
 not all covered in ash</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> What are you blabbering about now, Tonto?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Can you honestly look me in the eye and say that you 
 are not scared shitless? - this isn't freaking you out at all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> I am DONE being freaked out, man - dealing with a superhuman 
 fish chick pretty much put me over the top</p>

<div class="stage">Craig manages to chuckle.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> I'm just waiting for the splatter of frogs and locusts 
 on the windshield</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Not now, PLEASE not now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> I wonder what her connection is to all of this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Aleta Oscura</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Right, she is responsible for a naturally occurring 
 tectonic event?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> There aint nothing natural about ANY of this mierda 
 but I do know she's dead center!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> Let's refocus and try to keep Chaparral Heights from 
 being the next Pompeii</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Spare me the Jeopardy question and check out the military 
 squawk that's coming over this chan... AYYY</p>

<div class="stage">Two U.S. fighter jets zoom past them on a rapid ascent. 
 Anita fights against the wake and quickly regains control.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c09_chopper_jets.jpg" h="403" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Holding his mouth) Not again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING HERE?</p>

<div class="stage">The lieutenant spins the helicopter around and scans 
 out the port side.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> And why is there a special ops Apache hovering at 10 
 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Craig</span> They're most likely responding to the eruption</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Unless I missed the memo, I don't think firing missiles 
 at a volcano is standard protocol... there's something else going on 
 down there!</p>

<div class="stage">Nearly jumping out of his skin, Karl Senior rears against 
 his bed as Stephanie keeps the needle aimed at Hector.</div>

<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c09_steph_hector.jpg" h="406" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> What do you mean Joe's dead? - why are you dressed 
 like that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> HE'S ONE OF THEM, KILL HIM</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Kill him? - Karl, just relax - Hector, what in God's 
 name is going on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> I'll do my best to explain it in the simplest of terms 
 later...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> (Lowering the needle) SIMPLE TERMS? - you're talking 
 to an MD who graduated summa from Stanford, don't you dare condescend 
 to me!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> (Glancing out the window) Now is not the time for this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN, HE HAS POWERS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Powers? - he can barely pick his underwear up off 
 the floor</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> (Sultry voice) That's because I hardly wore any with 
 you, Stephi, you liked it that way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> UGH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Tell me what happened to Joe?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> There's nothing you can do for him now - COME, we must 
 leave here - the lava flow is headed in this direction</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU OR YOUR KIND</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> Karl, where is this racism coming from?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> It's not racism</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> Look, von Meer, I had PLENTY of opportunities to kill 
 you... but I couldn't - if I had offered you up, my stature would have 
 been elevated even more... but I didn't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> Why didn't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> I did not agree with what was taking place... they 
 misused the Marked One</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> (In tears) No!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> And because of that, we're all doomed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> (Hearing the fire alarm) I have NO idea what is 
 going on here but we need to leave, the hotel is being evacuated</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> Is your patient up to it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> He'll have to be - we need to keep him hidden from 
 the guests</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> With Mt. Wiggins, do you really think people will take 
 notice?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> I can't take the chance... I promised Erika</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> Erika...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> (Handing over his blue robe) Here, he can put this 
 on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> I'D RATHER DIE BEFORE I'D WEAR THAT RAG</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Hector</span> You very well could!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> ENOUGH - Hector, go get my car - Karl, keep calm 
 and put this on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Karl</span> But...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Stephanie</span> NO ARGUMENTS, LET'S GO</p>

 NOT - TELL ME WHO OR WHAT YOU ARE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span> I can't honestly explain this to you right now but I promise 
 I'll tell you everything, baby, I will</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> I knew you were into crystals and candles and crap but 
 I didn't know you took it to a cult level - what kind of psychotropic 
 shit did your buddies trip me on? - peyote, datura, what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span> I'm... I'm not sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> THEY HAVE MORRI, WHAT DID THEY DO TO MORRI?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span> (Tears flowing) I'm going back for her</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span> Keep moving, Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Who is this Darkfin she called out for? - is that your 
 leader?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span> No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> Then, who is?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span> My father...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Your dad? - I thought you said your dad was dead?
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span>  He is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Stop, stop, STOP WITH THE FREAK SHOW, RIGHT NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Amy</span> Stay on this path, it will lead you to Via Royal in about 
 a quarter of a mile</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Zach</span> Where are you going?</p>

<div class="stage">A gust of wind brushes Zach's face as he turns around. 
 Amethyst is gone.</div>

 pizza, watching the latest Olsen Twin movie - I was SUPPOSED to be doing 
 my laundry...</p>

 tell with your wardrobe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> (Holding a cold drink to the back of her head) As 
 a woman of science, I can tell you that tonight's happenings are most 
 profound</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> I'm so glad you explained that to me, WOMAN OF SCIENCE, 
 I never would have reached that conclusion on my own!</p>

 in the world and you're whining about an Olsen Twin movie? - get a life!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> NONE of us are going to have a life if that thing keeps 
 spewing like it is</p>

 nearly decapitated Jimmy Daddy - this mailbox shaped like a sunbathing

 MORRIGAN?</p>

 horror of it</p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> I'M GONNA KICK YOUR FAT ASS, TAKANACHI</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Gracie</span> YOU'D HAVE TO MOVE YOUR FATTER ASS, FIRST</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Kylee</span> (Turning the camera back on herself) And this is for 
 Kendra McCauley, I was the one who trashed your homecoming float, not
