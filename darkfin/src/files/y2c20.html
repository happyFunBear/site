  <h1>Year 2, Chapter 20</h1><h2>Through The Hooking Glass</h2>

<div class="stage">Staggering around her lair under the island 
 of Concha Dos, Darkfin tries to figure out what exactly what went 
 wrong with the fresh-water transmogrification.
</div>

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y2c20_df_sick.jpg" width="420" height="538"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span>: (Clutching her head) This... this is 
 bad</p>

<div class="stage">Her hand shaking, she throws her pen aside 
 and takes out a mini tape recorder.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Squinting at her watch) It's been 
 about five hours since I took a dive in the family duck pond - the 
 morph was complete but everything else... is completely off the scale 
 - temperature fluctuations, hypersensitivity, severe aggressive behavior... 
 I nearly fed on Ben's youngest</p>

<div class="stage">Taking her vital signs, she slumps down 
 and sits cross-legged on the sandy ground.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I have the overwhelming urge to jump 
 into the seawater before me again but I'm afraid it might trigger 
 a more adverse reaction - I need to revert to a fully human state 
 once more</p>

<div class="stage">Shivering, Aleta Oscura reaches over to 
 a trunk and pulls out a wool blanket.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Wrapping herself up in it) It's so... 
 so cold</p>

<div class="stage">She glances up to still see the earlier 
 IM chat she had with Morrigan still on the screen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Exhaling slowly) You are going to 
 have to get through tonight without me - I need to rest... recuperate... 
 DAMMIT</p>

<div class="stage">Images of a smiling McBride, ominously 
 surrounded by hooded figures, flashes in Aleta Oscura's mind.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Rubbing her eyes) Yet, I also have 
 an overwhelming fear that something is horribly wrong - I must go 
 ashore!</p>

<div class="stage">Not noticing the urgent e-mail from KJ 
 now flashing on the screen, Darkfin tosses off the blanket and summons 
 the trident into her hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Two hours back by boat is too long, 
 I need to swim, I need to go... NOW</p>

<div class="stage">Hurling herself into the water with every 
 ounce of strength she has, Darkfin feels no immediate reaction. She 
 continues to swim across the ocean towards Duquesa Bay. Upon surfacing, 
 there is a drastic change in her coloring.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Staring down at her body) So much 
 for camouflage
</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">Finishing her evening rounds at Bay Valley 
 Medical Center, Dr. Stephanie Gates prepares to leave.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (On her cell phone) I will not have 
 this argument with you again, Hector... no, I will not meet you there, 
 leave it alone!</p>

<div class="stage">She snaps the phone shut and returns some 
 charts to the nurse's front desk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> All set, doctor?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Pretty much - it looks like it's 
 going to be a quiet night - please be sure to check Mr. Wilkins' Foley 
 in twenty minuets</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> No problem - any fun plans?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Sighing) I finally thought I'd have 
 the opportunity to see my daughter but, surprisingly, she's busy</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> (Checking her computer screen) Ooh, got 
 a new one rolling in - a 62-year-old white male, possible MI</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Walking away) Not my problem, I'm 
 officially off duty</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> Uh, it says here the patient's name is 
 Karl von Meer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Freezing) KARL?
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y2c20_steph.jpg" width="478" height="466"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Nurse</span> The ETA is two minutes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Running) CALL THE TRAUMA TEAM AND 
 TELL THEM I'M ON MY WAY</p>

<div class="stage">The ambulance finally arrives and rushes 
 in Karl with a panicked Pauline and KJ beside him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> WHAT HAPPENED?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Sobbing) We were just having dinner... 
 and he... he slumped over - HELP HIM, PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Did he eat something bad, was he 
 choking at all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No, no... not that we could tell!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> (Hitting her son on his arm) FIND YOUR 
 SISTER, NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Exasperated) I'M TRYING, I'VE TRIED EVERY 
 WAY TO CONTACT HER, SHE'S NOT ANSWERING</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> THEN GO OUT THERE AND LOOK FOR HER, 
 KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I SHOULD STAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I want you two to wait out here, 
 I'll let you know as soon as I know something, I promise</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Pauline</span> I'M NOT LEAVING HIM</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> MOM - please, let her work, we'll just be 
 outside!</p>

<div class="stage">Giving a reassuring squeeze to Pauline's 
 hand and a quick nod to KJ, Stephanie closes off the ER room and attends 
 to the elder von Meer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (To the EMT) What are his vitals?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">EMT</span> BP 90/60 and dropping fast, pulse is erratic 
 at 150, shallow breathing, in and out of consciousness...
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/ysc20_karlsr_gurney.jpg" width="520" height="430"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Checking Karl out herself) DAMMIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">EMT</span> Two lines were started en route but we 
 can't get a good flow going</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> His color is bad... KARL, KARL, CAN 
 YOU HEAR ME?</p>

<div class="stage">His eyes slowly flutter open for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> Steph?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Yes, Karl, right here - can you tell 
 me anything?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> (Struggling) You... you need...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Leaning closer to him) What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Karl Sr.</span> To protect her...</p>

<div class="stage">He abruptly vomits a putrid substance 
 into his oxygen mask.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Clearing his airway) DEAR GOD, WHAT 
 IS THAT SMELL?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">EMT</span> HE'S CRASHING</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> GIVE ME A BAG</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">EMT</span> PULSELESS V-TAC</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> CHARGE THE PADDLES... HOLD ON, KARL, 
 PLEASE</p>

<bar></bar>

<div class="stage">With lights and sirens blaring, several 
 cop cars pull up to Morrigan McBride's residence. The two lead detectives 
 strut up to the front door and bang on it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective 1</span> OPEN UP, MS. MCBRIDE, WE HAVE A 
 WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective 2</span> PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS DIFFICULT</p>

<div class="stage">An officer hurries over to them from around 
 the garage.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Officer</span> No one's home - I checked the main 
 house and there's no sign of the landlady, either!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective 1</span> (Smacking the door) SHIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective 2</span> PUT OUT AN IMMEDIATE APB FOR BOTH</p>

<div class="stage">With the sirens blaring behind in the 
 distance, Morrigan stumbles along the creekside, using the brush for 
 cover. The hand of a nude Amy is forcefully pulling her.
</div>

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y2c20_amy_morri.jpg" width="620" height="495"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Out of breath) STOP... AMY, STOP, 
 PLEASE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Wincing at her cut, bare feet) You 
 didn't even give me a chance to put on my shoes!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Looking up at the sky) There is no 
 time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I really appreciate what you're trying 
 to do for me... but I can't outrun the police</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> It's not the police I'm worried about... 
 C'MON</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why are you naked? - what is that 
 light coming from your crystal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Sharp tone) WHY IS THE BOTTOM OF 
 YOUR LEFT FOOT GLOWING?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OH, GREAT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Let's go, we're almost there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> TRUST ME, MORRIGAN, YOU HAVE TO...</p>

<div class="stage">Inside his recently purchased storefront, 
 Brad Martel reluctantly goes through some paperwork.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (To himself) I'll show you, father, Griffin 
 is NOT the only Martel that can handle a business</p>

<div class="stage">Doug and Stephanie's youngest turns up 
 the sound system and blasts the music of a local industrial band he 
 manages. He does not hear Penelope Renselier enter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Sneaking up behind him and covering 
 his eyes) Is that a new track from &quot;Ministers of Toxin?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Jumping) FUCK</p>

<div class="stage">Brad pushes her off and steps back to 
 see the startled girl.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> PENNY... whoa, I am so sorry - I didn't 
 know it was you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Trying not to look hurt) Obviously</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Trying to hug her) C'mere</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Now pushing him off) GO TO HELL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Seriously, it's not a wise move to be 
 lurking around in an abandoned building, especially in this part of 
 town</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Smirking) You seem to be perfectly comfortable 
 here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I was... until you made me soak my shorts</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Soaked with exactly what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> As much as I get off on your little nympho-tease 
 routine, I'm not in the mood tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> That's unlike you, Bradley</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Going back to his paperwork) Tell me 
 about it - why aren't you with your mom at that museum meeting?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> She's a big girl, she can handle it without 
 me... make someone else carry her coffee for once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> And good old Uncle George?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Miffed) In the state hole called &quot;Sacto&quot; 
 or the sub hole called &quot;Tim&quot; - one or the other... or both</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Should I ask my dad to talk to him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> It's no use... let's change the subject 
 please</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> OK</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Biting her lip) You know, we haven't 
 even decided on a name for this place yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Checking a calculator) I think &quot;Weird 
 Crap For Sale&quot; says it all</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Is there anything I can do to help?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Not looking at her) Go home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Pissed) ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> LOOK, I need to concentrate and I can't 
 do that if I'm staring at your tits all night!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Smiling and flashing her bra) You'd 
 only STARE at my tits all night?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Rubbing his flushed cheeks) What is it, 
 a full moon out tonight or something? - why don't you go play with 
 your puppy dog and let a real man get back to work?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> HEY, YOU WANTED ME IN THIS BUSINESS WITH 
 YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I do and I want to get this business off 
 the frigging ground but that's taking more time and more money than 
 I had originally planned</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I can help you, I'm smart</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I KNOW you are but I need to get this 
 paperwork finished by morning</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Folding her arms and walking off in 
 a huff) Fine, maybe I WILL go play with my puppy dog... Jeremy is 
 awesome at licking my face!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Before she reaches the door) WAIT</p>

<div class="stage">Penelope stifles a grin and slowly turns 
 around.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Yeeeees?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Sighing) Amy was here earlier today setting 
 up a bunch of her candles and crystals in the back room</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Jealous tone) Amy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Amethyst Hill</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Yeah, I know who she is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Maybe you could double-check the SKU's?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> SKU's?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> &quot;Stock Keeping Unit&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Right...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Thanks</p>

<div class="stage">Brad, once again, attempts to finish his 
 paperwork when Penelope shrieks loudly from the other room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Scrambling over) WHAT'S WRONG?</p>

<div class="stage">He is astonished by the state of the room. 
 It is filled in every corner with lit candles, strategically placed 
 crystals hanging from the ceiling, and elaborate chalk drawings.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> WHAT THE FUCK DID SHE DO IN HERE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Delighted) You lying bastard...</p>

<div class="stage">Penelope goes up to Brad and kisses him 
 passionately on the lips.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> You knew I was coming all along</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Still baffled) Um...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Backing him against a wall) You always 
 know when I'm coming... I can't believe you staged this whole thing 
 just to get between my legs</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I... I... yeah, OK, whatever</p>

<div class="stage">Unable to resist any longer, Brad now 
 initiates the kissing and the two begin to consume each other. Amy 
 and Morrigan burst through the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> AAAAHHH</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> Sorry to interrupt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Scanning around) What are we doing 
 here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I WAS ABOUT TO ASK THE SAME THING</p>

<div class="stage">With a quick jerk, Penelope knees Brad 
 in the groin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Eyeing the naked Amy) YOU SICK FUCK, 
 NO WAY AM I DOING A THREE-WAY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (His voice an octave higher) I HAVE NO 
 IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON, HONESTLY, I DON'T</p>

<div class="stage">Falling into a cross-legged position in 
 the corner, Amethyst begins to rock and chant loudly.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Turning to Morrigan) What is she doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't know</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan studies Brad and Penny for a 
 moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Slapping Brad hard across the face) 
 HOW OLD IS THIS GIRL, DUDE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> DON'T SLAP HIM</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Near tears) I DIDN'T TOUCH HER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> YOUR HAND UP HER SHIRT SAYS OTHERWISE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> MIND YOUR BUSINESS, LADY, WHY ARE YOU 
 EVEN HERE?</p>

<div class="stage">The whole building begins to shake.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Ducking and covering) EARTHQUAKE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> MORRIGAN, GET IN THE CENTER OF THE 
 ROOM, NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHY?</p>

<div class="stage">The increasing sound of deep chanting 
 is now heard from outside of the building as an eerie glow floods 
 the windows.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> DOES ANYONE ELSE HEAR THAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Pleading with McBride) JUST DO IT, 
 DO IT NOW</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> DON'T OPEN THE DOOR
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y2c20_morri_taken.jpg" width="515" height="543"></p>


<div class="stage">As Morrigan heads for the center of the 
 room, her left foot is instantly drawn up to the center of a pictogram 
 on the ceiling. She screams in pain as Brad and Penny watch helplessly 
 and Amethyst continues to chant.</div>

<div class="stage">Captain Phelps and Lieutenant Fiore patrol 
 the marina in their USCG helicopter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Looking at his watch) Is this wise?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Our sources say the police will be arresting 
 McBride anytime now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Maybe we should be hovering over her 
 house?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> No, we need to be hovering over Aleta 
 Oscura's casa - and we are</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> What if she's already on shore?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> We have a tail on our KCON chica, she's 
 all alone except for her wacky landlady and a couple of cats</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Softly) Amethyst Hill?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah... enjoying a pleasant flashback?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That was a few years ago</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Chuckling) I remember</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> She gave great head but was too much 
 of a space case for me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Amy's a lot less maintenance than your 
 current &quot;warrior moon queen&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That's debatable</p>

<div class="stage">A slight bump is felt throughout the helicopter.</div>

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y2c20_chopper.jpg" width="620" height="379"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> What was that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You probably hit an air pocket... or 
 a bird</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> It didn't feel like that at all - something 
 else is wrong</p>

<div class="stage">The lieutenant checks her instruments.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> We've taken on weight!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> How is that possible?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> HOLD ON, I'M GOING TO TRY A FEW MANEUVERS</p>

<div class="stage">She attempts two sudden turns and then 
 comes to slow hover near the shore.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Everything seems to be fine - I don't 
 understand it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> CHECK OUT YOUR BRACELET</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/y2c20_anita.jpg" width="620" height="520"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Is it some bizarre Saint Elmo's Fire 
 type deal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I have no clue, it's only done this a 
 few other times before - my folks freaked out when it did</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I think we better head back to base</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> NO... she's here - can't you sense it? 
 - I bet that's what the weight is... KEEP IT STEADY FOR ME, PHELPS</p>

<div class="stage">Anita twists her body and tries to search 
 the back of the helicopter. She now cranes her neck out of the door
