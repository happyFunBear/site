<div class="stage">Deep inside the caverns of the Kiyomi Mountains, &quot;The 
 Clergy&quot; finishes a morning chant ritual and gathers to listen to 
 their leader in the white robe. A figure in a blue robe reverently approaches 
 the leader, genuflects and bows.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> We await your word</p>

<div class="stage">The white robe slowly circles around the blue robe and 
 then suddenly kicks the figure across the floor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> The word is disappointment</p>

<div class="stage">Another blue robe steps forward and falls to its knees.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Although we had some difficulties, last night was 
 moderately successful</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Please point out to me the success</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> We have eliminated a major obstacle in Karl von 
 Meer - drilling will now commence at a more rapid pace</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Tell me, where is his body?</p>

<div class="stage">The other hooded figures in the room all look at each 
 other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> (Trying not to stammer) At the morgue</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Inching closer) Are you sure of this?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Very sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Did you see the body with your own eyes?</p>

<div class="stage">The Blue Robe does not respond. In turn, the leader violently 
 lifts it off of the ground with one hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> I asked you a question</p>

<div class="stage">The captive can only respond by choking and gasping. 
 It is thrown back down to the ground.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> I am waiting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> (Sucking in air) I... we followed him... to the 
 hospital... we saw him flatline in the ER... we assumed he was shipped... 
 to the coroner's office</p>

<div class="stage">The leader slaps the subordinate hard across the head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> ASSUME NOTHING - TWO OF YOU, GO NOW AND CONFIRM 
 THE BODY</p>

<div class="stage">A pair quickly rises and exits the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Does anyone else here care to justify how last 
 night was a success?</p>

<div class="stage">Yet another blue robed figure speaks out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Forgive us, Master, we did not expect the aberration 
 to adapt so quickly</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> But she did, didn't she?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> We have figured out the modulation she used last 
 night and we will be prepared for her the next time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Her trident is not a concern, her physical alteration 
 is!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> We are still working on theories</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Work harder - I want proven conclusions, not theories!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Yes, Master</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Have we discovered the user of the rocket launcher?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> It was a government-issue rocket launcher favored 
 by the CIA and the user was definitely female</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> Another added element we do not need</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> We are putting together a sketch of her face and 
 we will hunt this woman down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> That can wait, I want all of you searching for 
 The Marked One - is that clear?</p>

<div class="stage">A unanimous affirmative is heard from the gathering. 
 Another blue robe enters the room and approaches the leader but does 
 not bow.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> Actually, we do have a bright spot from last night... 
 literally - BRING HER IN 
</p>
<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c03_amy.jpg" h="456" w="510"/>
<div class="stage">Two other hooded figures drag in Amethyst Hill and throw 
 her at the feet of the leader. She is covered in tribal mud paint and 
 is missing her crystal necklace.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Blue Robe</span> I am certain she will be able to tell you where 
 The Marked One is!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">White Robe</span> (Kneeling and carefully lifting her face) Disclose 
 her location</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Amethyst</span> (Jerking away) Never, father... NEVER</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Staring at the ruins of their former storefront, Penelope 
 Renselier and Brad Martel sit on the curb in silence as firefighters 
 and other emergency personnel secure the block.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Studying Brad) You know, we could be in body bags right 
 now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Almost got your wish, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I never want to die like that - my death will be of 
 my own choosing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Glad you think you have a say in that matter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> What I want to know is where did Morri and Amy go?</p>

<div class="stage">Brad shrugs his shoulders and continues to stare off 
 into space.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Softly) We searched the rubble, bit by bit, FOUR times... 
 where did they go?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Hanging his head) Just be glad we DIDN'T find them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> They couldn't have just vanished</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Well, it appears that they did</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> There is something seriously psycho with those two... 
 and I'm not talking about barging in on us last night without their 
 clothes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> These past several hours have been... I don't know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> An interlude of weirdness?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> That's why you're a wordsmith!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Did you notice the type of destruction?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> If you look at the surrounding buildings on our block, 
 they look normal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Eyeing the devastation) You think that looks normal?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Normal as in hit by a good-sized quake, yes - but look 
 at our building...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Same thing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> No... REALLY look</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> I must be exhausted and blind because I have no clue 
 what you're referring to</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Our building... or what's left of it... has a concentric 
 implosion pattern while every other building is more random</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Finally seeing the difference) Huh, that's strange... 
 AND?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> What do you mean &quot;and?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> And what does that tell you? - it's still destroyed, 
 but in a prettier way - BIG FUCKING DEAL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> It IS a big deal!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Why? - does that mean we'll get more insurance money 
 out of it or that it will look better on the KCON news footage of local 
 damage?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> You just don't get it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> No, I don't - and I don't really want to - we have other 
 things to worry about</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Rubbing Brad's back) Stop stressing - you can get one 
 of those SBA disaster loans or something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Not with my record</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Then you can always ask your family</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Flinging a chunk of brick) Screw that!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Now is so not the time to be stubborn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Now is the time to shut the hell up, here come the cops!</p>

<div class="stage">Two police officers with a dog and a detective come over 
 to Brad and Penny.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> Are you two alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Considering we just lost our building and our business, 
 I guess we are</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> Do you two need any help?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Keep on walking, that would help</p>

<div class="stage">Brad elbows her in the side.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> We'll be fine, sir, thank you</p>

<div class="stage">The dog leads the officers over to the rubble and barks 
 anxiously.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> (Pulling out a photo of Morrigan and Amethyst) Have 
 you seen either of these two women recently?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Glancing at the picture) No, not recently</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Why, what did they do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> One is a fugitive from justice and the other, we 
 believe, is assisting her on the run</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Cool</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> No, NOT cool - if you know where they are, we need 
 to know... now!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Sorry, can't help you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Try looking in your underwear, maybe you'll find something 
 of interest in there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Shaking her arm) Penny, stop it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> Well, apparently our K-9 corps has found an interesting 
 scent coming from your building</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> We specialize in candles and incense, not to mention 
 the dead rats and gas leaks, I'm sure there are a lot of interesting 
 scents coming from our building!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> The dog is trained to pick up the scent of Ms. McBride 
 and Ms. Hill</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> The dog is also freaked by the earthquake - animals 
 are skittish and confused for days after</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> You are more that welcome to check the remains of our 
 store if you don't believe us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Detective</span> (Walking off) I might just do that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Yeah, they might be hiding under a shard of glass, be 
 sure to look closely you pig prick!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Covering her mouth on the last two words) WHAT IS WRONG 
 WITH YOU?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Snapping Brad's hand away) WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? 
 - &quot;WE'LL BE FINE, SIR, THANK YOU&quot; - WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Someone who is NOT looking for more trouble right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Since when did you turn kiss-ass to authority?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> Since I can't afford another strike on my record</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> You can't afford another strike on your bad boy rep 
 - I might as well be with Jere</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Evil grin) But, you're not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Leaning over to kiss Brad) No, I'm not</p>

<div class="stage">Around the corner, Jeremy Colvin is on his skateboard, 
 observing the entire scene with Brad, Penny and the cops. He hesitates 
 at first but then rushes over to the two of them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Shocked) HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Looking for you... all night - I thought you were hurt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Brad</span> (Getting up) I need to make sure the cops don't try to 
 plant anything</p>

<div class="stage">With quiet fury in his eyes, Jeremy watches Brad leave.
</div>
<p a="center"><img  src="assets/images/y3c03_trio.jpg" h="456" w="510"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> He's lucky there are cops around right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Flattered by the situation) Oh really?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Come on, we're going home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> I'm not walking all that way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> We'll take the bus</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Fun</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Don't you care about your family, have you even checked 
 on them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> Mom and dad are in Sacramento, they're fine</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Be grateful - the von Meers weren't as lucky</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Turning serious) Did something happen to fish lady?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Erika's dad died last night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> NO WAY - that's horrible - I wonder if I should go over 
 to their house?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> You could... or you could continue to sit here in the 
 dirt, making out with dirt</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> It wasn't like you were around</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I had to work two jobs and lay down some fresh tracks 
 last night!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> As usual</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Do you want to break up, is that it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penny</span> (Sighing) We'll discuss this later, let's go!</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside the Fiore farmhouse, everyone is gathered to comfort 
 an injured Anita and discuss last night's events.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Hanging up the phone) Craig's doctor wants to keep 
 him in the hospital for another day, just to be safe</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> I'll be sure to bring him some of my muffins later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Biting her lip) Yeah, I'm sure he'll love your muffins</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> (Glowering at Anita) WE'LL go see Craig later - I still 
 can't imagine how you two were able to jump out of the copter in time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Staring at her broken wrist in a cast) Luck, I guess</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Crossing herself) Not luck... the Lord!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Sure, ma, whatever</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Sitting in a recliner and lighting up a cigarette) 
 Has the Coast Guard contacted you or Captain Phelps at all?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I have a meeting with them this afternoon - if Craig 
 is up to it, we'll do a teleconference</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> They better give you two a medal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> MEDAL, HA - we'll be stunned if we aren't booted out 
 on our asses!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> 'Nita - such language!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Sorry, ma, but it's true - do you know how much those 
 birds cost? - and we toasted the most expensive one at our base</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Banging his cane down on the floor) IT WASN'T YOUR 
 FAULT - YOU HAD TERRORISTS TRYING TO KILL YOU</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm sure they'll find a way to make it our fault</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Homeland security... BULLSHIT</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Not you too, Francis!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Looking out the window) Here we go again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> WHAT? - I'm sorry for not being all PC like but it's 
 time to close the god damn borders and send everyone who shouldn't be 
 here packing!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Didn't your relatives come her illegally?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> That was a very long time ago and NOT THE POINT - times 
 have changed, the land of infinite wealth is long dead and forgive me 
 for not wanting to see my tax dollars spent on those who want to BLOW 
 UP MY DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Smiling at her dad) Aww, thanks papi</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Francis, PLEASE watch your blood pressure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Terrorists... is that really the conclusion the authorities 
 have come up with?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Pretty much</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> But it wasn't, was it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I have no idea - I cannot even begin to explain what 
 I saw last night and I'm not sure I want to</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Extremely agitated) You should FORGET what you saw 
 last night, be happy that you are here with your family and concentrate 
 on healing yourself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I need to concentrate on finding my bracelet - I think 
 I might have lost it at the hospital</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Looking away) Don't worry, I have it in a safe place</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Turning to face her mother) Where is it? - AYYY, bastard 
 rib!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Jumping up) Let me go get you some fresh ice for 
 your bruises</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Will everyone stop it, por favor? - I'll be fine, really, 
 just let me be - I'm more worried about dad now that McBride has high-tailed 
 it out of town</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> There is no way they can come after him as a suspect</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Still staring out the window) Don't be so sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Can we please deal with one family crisis at a time?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> That reminds me, I need to make a casserole and bring 
 it over to the von Meers - KJ must be devastated</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Right, poor KJ - he gets to inherit a fortune!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Don't be so mean, Javier - do you forget how you 
 felt when you lost your father?</p>

<div class="stage">There is silence in the room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Remember that Erika is affected as well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> I wonder if they were finally able to find her?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> She's missing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> KJ called three times asking if she was at the lab 
 last night</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Huh... that's odd - I still can't believe Old Man Karl 
 kicked it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> I will stop by the church later and have a mass said 
 for him</p>

<div class="stage">The phone rings in the kitchen and Ona Rosa answers it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Anita, it's for you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I don't want to talk to anyone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> It's someone named Marcy Nolan?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Jumping off of the sofa) I'll take it in the other 
 room!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Oh, I almost forgot - Frank, while we were driving 
 up, we thought we saw the lights on in the old bunkhouse - are you doing 
 something down there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> No, I'm not - it must be those damn squatters again 
 - Carmie, bring me my 12 gauge!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> NO, NO MORE GUNS - WE DO NOT NEED YOU IN ANOTHER MESS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> (Holding up his hand) Stay seated, Frank, I'll go take 
 care of it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Need some help?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> NO... thanks - I can handle it!</p>

<div class="stage">Hector is out the door and on his way. Anita watches 
 him from the kitchen window.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (On the phone with Marcy) So, can you come over? - WHY? 
 - I'd really like you to be here for me now... that's a total excuse 
 - OK, you know what, NEVERMIND - when you decide to break away from 
 fantasy land and learn how to relate to REAL human beings instead of 
 characters on a stage, LET ME KNOW</p>

<div class="stage">Anita bangs down the phone and sulks for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Heading out the side door) I better see if Uncle Hector 
 needs some help</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">At the von Meer estate, Erika sits silently in the living 
 room, itching at a tiny patch of scales under her fingers. She observes 
 the activities around her. Griffin speaks on a phone, Ben is in the 
 kitchen with Joe making lunch, Shelby is lighting candles and doing 
 some kind of ceremony with pineapples, Tim is speaking with concerned 
 neighbors and Kylee is doing a report for KCON in the front yard. Coming 
 from the master bedroom, KJ sluggishly ambles down the stairs with Dr. 
 Stephanie.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> (To KJ) That should hold her for awhile</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Rubbing his bloodshot eyes) Thanks, Steph</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> Keep an eye on your mom and I'll be by later 
 tonight to check in on her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Going over to them) Is she going to be alright?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Steph had to tranq her up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> She'll be fine, she just needed a little something 
 to calm her down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I just don't understand how the hospital could make such 
 a stupid mistake - no one authorized dad... his body... for release</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dr. Stephanie</span> I know - I'm on my way over there right now
