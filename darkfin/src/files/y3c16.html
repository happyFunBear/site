<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> Welcome back to KCON's special presentation, &quot;Mountain Meltdown: One Week Later&quot; - I'm Dan Henshaw...</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y3c16_claudia.jpg" alt="" h="513" w="642"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> And I'm Claudia Steel - the eruption at Mt. Wiggins was more than unsettling for many of our viewers but what has truly amazed emergency personnel, as well as local residents, is how rapidly things have returned to normal...</p>

<div class="stage">Captain Craig Phelps is shown in a sound bite.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Frankly, we are stunned, the way that mountain blew... this valley dodged a mighty bullet - everybody has been working very hard, helping out when and wherever - the community has truly come together</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> No new eruptions have occurred since the initial blast and seismic activity in the area has dramatically decreased - sadly, the current death toll stands at 82</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> Well, Claudia, I may be sweeping ash off of my prized eggplants for some time but traffic is flowing faster than hot lava...</p>

<div class="stage">Claudia glares at him.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> (Clearing his throat) All roads in and out of the county are clear and in use - FEMA centers remain stationed throughout the city and anyone needing assistance is encouraged to contact the number on your screen</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Clean-up crews have already begun to assess the damage in the north-eastern part of the valley - the south end of Quartz Lake has sustained the most devastation - SCU's chief biologist, Dr. Javier Sanchez, is heading a team to determine what course of action is needed...</p>

<div class="stage">A perfectly preened Sandy is shown on screen in a soundbite.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Javier</span> Right now, we just don't know for sure - it might take decades for the lake's ecosystems to fully recover but we will do everything humanly possible to help this landmark return to its natural state</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> The Quartz County park commissioner is also on site and predicts that the upper end of the lake will be ready for use in a matter of weeks - for many residents, the tragic death of local entrepreneur, Joseph Tiszo, and the destruction of the historic Quartz Lake Inn are devastating losses... on a personal note, Joe always admired my mushrooms and I will forever be an ardent fan of his grapes - we'll miss you, Big J!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Uh, yes... in another shocking loss, Beacon Point residents are still mourning the sudden death of Meeramar's, Karl von Meer - the Duquesa Bay shipping giant died of a heart attack just over a week ago - later today, his family will hold a private ceremony aboard the company's lead tanker - several foreign and national dignitaries are expected, including the state's governor - von Meer's ashes will then be buried at sea</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> When we come back, Austin Ortega is here with the weekend weather forecast...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> (Dramatic face) What could be worse than chunks of molten rock and layers of icky ash? - RAIN, that's right, RAIN... and plenty of it!</p>

<div class="stage">Austin pops open a wildly-colored umbrella and twirls it over his head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> Say &quot;see ya&quot; to the Cali sunshine and hola to a whole lot of precipitation - stay tuned</p>

<div class="stage">As they go to a commercial break, Claudia takes two antacids and chases them with a Starbucks double espresso. Dan checks his appearance in a large mirror held up by a production assistant while Austin mambos with the umbrella.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> How long is it going to rain?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> My forecast is just minutes away</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> (Barking) Ortega!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> (Holding up his hand) Chill, sister - on and off for the next week - and it will be unusually heavy for this time of year</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Christ, I just did my hair</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> You did?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> Bad times for your follicles is fantastic news for my rutabagas</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Does anyone know where the hell Turner disappeared to this week? - we're supposed to have my semi-annual review and the sneaky bastard was a no-show</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> Why don't you ask Lady Shepperton? - I'm sure she knows everything, and I do mean everything, about our Master Gates</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> I don't need to know how many moles are on his cock, I need to know when I can schedule an appointment with the asshole!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> (Whispering) Um, Claw - you might want to find different word usage... your children are here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> (Turning around) What?</p>

<div class="stage">Dressed in black, Ben and the three kids are waving and smiling from the corner of the set.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Oh... hi</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> Honey, don't forget, we have to be at the memorial in an hour</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> Right, we're almost finished</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hannah</span> Mommy, what's a cock?</p>

<div class="stage">Austin doubles over with laughter.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Palmer</span> Shut up retard, it's a rooster!</p>

<div class="stage">The young boy jumps around, flapping his arms and crowing.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> I believe mother was using a colloquial term that falls under the category of obscenity - right, daddy?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> BENJAMIN, GET THEM OUT OF HERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> C'mon kids, we'll wait for mom in the control room</p>

<div class="stage">In Claudia's earpiece, the director begs her to send them somewhere else.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Claudia</span> ALL OF YOU, IN THE CAR, NOW - I'll be there in 10 minutes!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> (To Claudia) You know, if you ever need specifically shaped vegetables to use as teaching tools, feel free to ask - I have this gourd...</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside Techtonic, Gracie watches Austin's weather report on the TV over the bar. She pours herself a beer and sighs. Jeremy steps away from the DJ booth and joins her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Grabbing a soda) Was it really that bad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Huh?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I just played my latest track for you and not one word</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Oh, sorry - I'm a little out of it... okay, a lot out of it right now</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy glances up to the KCON news on screen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> It wasn't you fault</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Tell that to the station</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Whoever stole the newsvan is to blame - it was a time of chaos and panic, like you could have stopped a gang of thugs from boosting it!</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie sits quietly and sips her beer.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> They had no right to suspend you without pay</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> There was a million dollars worth of equipment in that van</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Your creep boss bleeds money, besides, the insurance should cover it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> That's not the point - the point is that it was my responsibility and I failed in that responsibility</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> That's such bullshit</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I know, but with the way things are going lately, I'm just happy to have my eight fingers and my gig here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Um, they didn't tell you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Tell me what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Ooh...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Spit it out, Colvin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> The club has decided to add two new nights - salsa and swing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You have GOT to be kidding me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> We now have to compete with the other DJ's for the remaining nights</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> No frigging way!</p>

<div class="stage">Gracie downs the rest of her drink and pours herself a shot of whiskey.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It's... it's all just getting out of hand - Morri, the crazy happenings, the van...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Zach</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Nearly choking) ZACH - what do you know about Zach?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Nothing... except that it always comes down to Isaacson with you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Well, sadly, not anymore - I honestly don't know how to handle his huge problem - he needs serious help and I just can't be the life raft this time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> That's kinda harsh - can't you at least throw him an oar?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It's all so overwhelming right now - I'm having trouble processing anything except alcohol content</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Maybe you should take a trip to Seattle and see your family?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I went back home to my folks once with my tail between my legs - HA, never again!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> It was right after my divorce - for two solid weeks, my mom kept reminding me how much better off I would have been if I had married my second cousin in Yokohama and then my dad kept shaking his head at me the entire time - and my brother with his sarcastic putdowns...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Surely he can't top the master?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I was his apprentice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Whoa - you are better off down here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Or in Oahu - I have friends there that I haven't seen in awhile, now might be the time - oh, wait, that's right, I have no money... so, I guess I'll be getting me a Jamba Juice job application on the way home</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Don't you get alimony?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Nope, it was an amicable divorce, we each got half of diddlysquat because that's what we had and that's what we agreed to</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy thinks for a moment, reaches into his pocket and gives Gracie a wad of hundred-dollar bills.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? - ARE YOU SELLING DRUGS?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Hardly - I might get baked now and then but I'm no dealer - the last thing my mom and little bro need is me behind bars</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Then, how did you get this? - your girlfriend?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> No... Pen doesn't pay for me anymore</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Hey, how's she doing? - it must have been horrible inside that jet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Dunno - haven't seen her since she got home - she won't speak to me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> So, where did you get the roll of dead presidents?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I have this totally cool side job - and it's going to hit really big, really soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Excellent, can I get in on it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Sorry, I wish you could, but it's a member's only kind of deal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> By members, do you mean special people or penis only?</p>

<div class="stage">Jeremy chuckles and finishes his soda.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Turning serious) Jere - you're a good kid - look me in the eye and promise me that you aren't doing anything illegal</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> I swear, it's all legit - don't worry about me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> You aren't selling body parts... or fluids?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> It hasn't come down to that... yet - that was a joke, relax</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Why can't you tell me about this job?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> Maybe someday... but not now - as a friend, please don't ask, just take the cash as repayment for all the times you bailed me out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Thinking) Okay... but you take my turntable in return</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> How about I borrow it until you get back to the mainland?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I could live with that - thanks, Jere!</p>

<div class="stage">The two give each other a big hug. It's obvious Jeremy has deeper feelings for Gracie.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jeremy</span> (Sighing) You'll be a lot safer away from here, Grace, trust me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Pulling back) What?</p>

<div class="stage">Before Jeremy can answer, Jason enters the club and walks with a slight limp over to them.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Jason</span> We need to talk, Takanachi</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Penelope, George, and Lydia are dressed in black rain slickers. They are crowded in with a dozen other people in a tiny boat that ferries them to the Meeramar cargo tanker.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> It would have been a lot easier if we went by helicopter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> After what happened... this boat is perfectly fine</p>

<div class="stage">Water sprays across their faces as storm clouds loom in the distance. Penny wipes her face and glares at her father.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Clutching her cane) George, I'm going to need at least two other people helping me onto that monstrosity</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I know that, Lydia, I'll take care of it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> How absurd to hold the memorial out here on this thing - why couldn't it have been on their yacht?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> This was Karl's business after all, it seems appropriate - and there wouldn't have been enough room on the yacht</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Well, they sure do expect a lot from us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> It's not supposed to be about us</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> (Looking up at the sky) When are we going to talk about what happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> What, dear?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> What happened in the plane?</p>

<div class="stage">George deliberately turns away.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> It's been a week now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Be grateful we are here today instead of where poor Karl is and simply leave it at that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> I want to know what happened to me - I have a right to know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> It was a fortunate fluke, now drop it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Penelope</span> Fluke my ass!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">George</span> I SAID leave it alone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> Penelope, watch your language - George, keep your voice down - the two of you need to remember why we're here</p>

<div class="stage">The boat pulls up to side of the tanker as George ignores his daughter's scowl. Lydia struggles to her feet as Penelope rips off her slicker to reveal a bright red dress.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y3c16_penny_in_red.jpg" alt="" h="487" w="510"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Lydia</span> (Rolling her eyes) The one day she decides to wear color...</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Around 300 people dressed in formal black gather on the deck of Der Herzog, Meeramar's premier shipping tanker. A huge banner bearing a grinning image of a younger Karl on his first yacht hangs over dozens of white-flowered wreaths and a lone candle. People mill about as Erika sneaks off around a corner with Stephanie.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Pretty decent turn out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Have you talked to him today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> About an hour ago - he insisted that I bring a mini video camera because he wants to see the whole thing - who says something nice... who doesn't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Heh, I see my father still has a flare for the macabre</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> It's remarkable how well he's recovering, thanks to you - the antidote will be written up in science journals for sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It would have killed him outright if it didn't work - I had to take the risk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Still no idea who did this or why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Long pause) I need to investigate further</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> There's so much I don't understand, Erika - Hector is even more of a mystery than you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> When you see him again, please thank him - if there's anything he ever needs, financially or otherwise, tell him to contact me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Arms folded) If I see him again...</p>

<div class="stage">Erika nods at the ornate golden urn on display. It is the center of everyone's attention.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> So, who... or what is inside?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> &quot;Anna no last name&quot; - courtesy of Bay Valley Medical Center's indigent cases - she was a crabby old wino with no family or friends, not to mention teeth - the few brain cells that weren't soaked in booze were riddled with cancer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Ah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I figured she deserved a nice send off</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y3c16_erika_steph.jpg" alt="" h="501" w="453"  b="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> How munificent of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Besides, it's a great way to get back at my ex - taking this tanker out on a dry run must be costing Doug plenty</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Searching the crowd) I know he's a complete ass but I can't believe he didn't show up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Sighing) I can... why do you think I divorced the bastard? - he may be your father's business partner but they stopped being friends long ago</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Still...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I asked Ben and no one has seen him since the volcano</p>

<div class="stage">Erika spots Ursula paying her respects to Pauline. Captain Craig Phelps struts by and shares a quick look with Ursula.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Funny, the current Mrs. Martel claims she had dinner with Doug last night and that he would have been here except that he wasn't feeling well - old polo injury</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> What a lying sack of shit!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Which one?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Oh, what does it matter? - we know the truth and won't they all be astonished when Karl rises from the dead?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That won't be for sometime - did you make more antidote in case our toxic terrorist turns up again?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> I have some with me at all times and there's a stash at the hospital</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Good</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> So, when are you going to visit him?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Isn't he safe at that clinic?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> That's not my question - Karl wants to see his daughter, why haven't you been by?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I've been...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Busy - busy throwing yourself off of buildings, disappearing when your family needs you, acting stranger than usual - what is going on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I can't get into this now, Stephanie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> If it were drugs, I would be relieved because it would offer a comprehensive explanation - but I know addicts and you do not fall into that category</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Smirking) Not everything falls into a simple category - as a doctor, you should know that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Then, what is it, Rikka? - why won't you let me help you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You have helped my father and that has been an immense help to me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> But...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That's all I care to discuss</p>

<div class="stage">The two stare at each other and then refocus on the gathering of mourners. The black clouds grow with intensity as the seas turn choppy.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Actually, you can help me with one other thing...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Name it</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Lend me your PDA - I need to check in with someone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> (Handing it to her) No problem</p>

<div class="stage">Victoria Martel waves to Stephanie and staggers over to a corner of the ship.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Stephanie</span> Oh dear, I see my daughter didn't take her seasick pills, I'll be right back</p>

<div class="stage">As Stephanie hurries off, KJ storms up to his sister.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Hey</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Noticing his bruised cheek) Kage?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> So glad you could make it today!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Don't start, little brother - who hit you in the face?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I fell</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That's not a fall, that's a punch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Why do you care?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Why are you causing a scene?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Oh, that's right, there should be no high emotion during a funeral</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I just want to know who hit you and why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Maybe if you showed up to the house, I would have told you what happened - where the hell were you all week?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> On my...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Boat - yes, I was there - you couldn't even let me in when I came by?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm sorry - I was having a very rough week</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Tearing up) We were ALL having a rough week - you were NOT the only one who lost dad</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Trying to wipe his face) I'll come home with you and mother after the service</p>
