  <h1>Year 1, Chapter 18</h1><h2>&quot;Evening Entertainment&quot;</h2>


<div class="stage">Docked in the mid-sized port of Duquesa Bay, a Meer-A-Mar Cargo ship carrying imported goods from Bulgaria rests quietly against the burgeoning night sky. Inside, a few members of its crew gather in a small room filled with various illegal weapons.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> (Polishing a machine gun) America does love its guns, doesn't it?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #2</span> (Unpacking a case of grenades) And I love its TV shows - hurry, it's almost time for &quot;Ancient Space&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> Keep your mind on the job</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #2</span> With the money we make from this, let's buy our whole town back home</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> Are you joking? - I will visit cousin in Vegas, buy lots of pretty American girls</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #2</span> There are pretty girls back home</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> Yes, but American girls are easy</p>
 
<div class="stage">A voice from in back of the men startles them.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Just how easy do you think we are?</p>
 
<div class="stage">Coming into the light, Darkfin faces the two and casually smiles. One of them screams.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> (Aiming his gun at her) God save us, what are you?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I ask myself that on occasion</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #2</span> KILL IT, KILL IT</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> OH, wait a minute, wait a minute... captain said something about a show filming on the dock today - &quot;Sigma Seven&quot; I think</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #2</span> SIGMA SEVEN? - I LOVE SIGMA SEVEN</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> (Smirking at Darkfin) I suggest you turn around, forget what you saw here or I'll have the studio cancel your contract... understand?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Is that a wise move before sweeps?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #2</span> Hey, can you get me BogRee's autograph?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Sorry... how about I do my best imitation of R'xal?</p>
 
<div class="stage">With one quick flip, Darkfin is on top of the second crewman, knocking him out cold. Before the first crewman can get a shot off, she jams the gun back into his chest, cracking a few ribs.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Picking him up by the neck) I want you to do me a favor</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y1c18_fight.gif" width="400" height="379" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> PLEASE DON'T KILL ME</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Placing him at the ship's intercom) Call for help</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> (Gasping) I can't... I can't breathe</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Tightening her hold) Then CALL... FOR... HELP</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #1</span> (Into the intercom) INTRUDER... INTRUDER, DECK C... HELP ME</p>
 
<div class="stage">With a flick of her wrist, the crewman is sent flying into the corner. Darkfin calmly struts out of the room and waits in the main cargo hold as over a dozen armed crewmen arrive.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Hello, boys - I'm bored... wanna play?</p>
 
<div class="stage">As two of them open fire, she leaps into the air and takes out three of them with a rounding kick. She then pitches and rolls, taking out two more. A large man comes up from behind and grabs around her. She breaks his foot and flips him over onto a crate. One crewman with a gun keeps firing at her as she ducks behind several stacked barrels.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #3</span> (Searching) WHERE DID SHE GO?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #4</span> (Kicking over a barrel) I DON'T KNOW</p>
 
<div class="stage">Sticking to the wall above them, the green marine menace whistles.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Waving) Excuse me, hi... up here!</p>
 
<div class="stage">Before the crewmen have a chance to react, she slams down hard on both. A crewman with a large machete lunges at her from the side, nicking her slightly on the back.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> NICE MOVE, CONGRATULATIONS</p>
 
<div class="stage">With one hand, she bats the machete away and then with the other, spreads out her sharp forearm fin and slices through his neck.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> My move is better</p>
 
<div class="stage">The remaining crewmen start to retreat and she chases after them. Now on the top deck of the ship, the captain looks around bewildered at the frightened crewmen.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Captain</span> What is going on here? - stop being cowards, turn around, and fight!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Smiling) Maybe you should turn around</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Captain</span> (Doing so) Huh?</p>
 
<div class="stage">With a quick gesture, Darkfin's trident flies out of the water and spears the captain through the chest. She pulls her weapon out of the body and glides down to the remaining crewmen, still desperately trying to flee.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y1c18_fight_2.gif" width="400" height="260" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Crewman #4</span> PLEASE, WE BEG YOU, LET US GO</p>
 
<div class="stage">Snapping off three, long, steel pipes from the ship, Darkfin tosses them to each crewman. She grabs her trident and takes a defensive posture.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Do as your captain said... stop being cowards and fight!</p>
 
<div class="stage">The three crewmen look at each other and then spread out to surround her. The next few moments are a flurry of clanging metal as Darkfin uses her trident as a fighting staff, whirling it around, smashing the pipes and knocking down two of her opponents. She trips up the last one as he tries to run, uses the tips of the trident to pick up the crewman by his jacket, carries him to the side of the ship and pitches him over.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Calling down after him) The water is a bit cold tonight, don't swim too long</p>
 
<div class="stage">With no one else to attack, she goes over to a certain spot on the deck and retrieves a black diver's watch and notes the time.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Strapping it to her wrist) Not a bad time for regular humans, not a good time if I stand any chance against the cloak freaks</p>
 
<div class="stage">With a deep sigh, she takes one last look around her and dives gracefully into the water below.</div>

<div class="stage">Inside the Fiore family farmhouse, Frank and his wife Carmen prepare a small dinner for their family. Craig Phelps plays ball with Ona Rosa's children as she watches on with her sister, Anita.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Half smile) Craig isn't just playing with the kids, he's actually trying to win</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Sipping a Corona Light) Yep, that's Crunch, he's always looking to score... speaking of which, where's your husband?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Scowling) He's staying late for a department meeting, he'll be here shortly</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Uh-huh</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Nita, don't start</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm not starting anything... that hasn't already been started</p>
 
<div class="stage">Hector Tapia pops his head out of the door and calls to his nieces.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Your mom needs some help in the kitchen, girls!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> We'll be right in, Tio</p>
 
<div class="stage">Running out and catching the ball, Anita stops the game between Craig and the kids.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Get on in and get cleaned up, supper is almost ready - Crunch, go help Oni with the salad</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (All smiles) My pleasure</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Following in after him) Yeah, I'll bet</p>
 
<div class="stage">As everyone gathers at the table, Frank is already seated at the head of it, glaring at his empty plate.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Bringing out the rolls) Don't lift a finger to help, Dad</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Now glaring at Anita) I can't lift my arm, let alone a finger</p>
 
<div class="stage">Ona Rosa and Craig appear from the kitchen with the salad and a pitcher of lemonade.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You know, Frank - I could talk to my buddy at the gym, he's a professional trainer, I'm sure he'd be more than happy to recommend some exercises for you</p>
 
<div class="stage">Anita and Ona Rosa roll their eyes at each other at the anticipated answer.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Another time, maybe - will someone let Bucko in?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Rushing to the back door) I'll get him</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Banging down some plates) Do we have to have the fucking dog at the dinner table? - he's filthy!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> (Entering the room with a casserole) And your mouth isn't? - Nita, SIT</p>
 
<div class="stage">Anita sighs and does as she's told as Craig makes an amused face at her. A large, German Shepherd/Bloodhound mix bounds over to Frank and settles at his feet.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> (Struggling to pat him) There's my boy, there's my boy!</p>
 
<div class="stage">After Ona Rosa seats the children at a smaller table in the other room, she returns to where the adults are gathered.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Taking a seat) It all looks delicious</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Looking at Ona Rosa) Yes, very tasty</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Thank you - Hector, please say grace for us</p>
 <p>Everyone clasps hands except for Frank who begrudgingly touches his wife's hand with his fingers.</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span></p>
 <p class="indent_floral">Drinking when we are not thirsty<br>
 and making love at all seasons<br>
 madam: that is all there is<br>
 to distinguish us from<br>
 the other animals</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> What the hell does that mean?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Maybe Bucko can explain it to you</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> It doesn't mention the Lord, it doesn't mention food... </p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> It was lovely, Hector, gracias</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> It's by Pierre-Augustin de Beaumarchais</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> I don't want to hear a freaky Frenchman's poem at my table!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Shoveling in a mouth full of vegetables) If you heard it in the bathroom, would it make a difference?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> NITA</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Holding up his glass) I'd like to make a toast... to a wonderful meal and to the extremely kind and extremely beautiful Fiore women, CHEERS</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> For that, Craig, you are getting an extra slice of my cherry pie</p>
 
<div class="stage">Anita laughs to herself.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I had an interesting meeting today with a lovely young woman</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Was it in the vertical or the horizontal position?</p>
 
<div class="stage">Carmen and Ona Rosa flash Anita a cross look.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Hey, what's wrong with a geometry question over mixed greens?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Actually, it was an interview</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Hallelujah, you're finally getting a real job!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> A NEWS interview, Francis - Morrigan McBride is doing a piece on the county correctional program</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Throwing down her napkin) Aw, man!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> What's the matter, Sis, did she turn you down?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I can't stand her, she's freaking everywhere - sticking her nose in where it doesn't belong - we have enough problems trying to figure out Aleta... </p>
 
<div class="stage">Craig gives her a sharp poke under the table.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Well, she seems like a sweet, well-informed, respectable journalist - she asked very intelligent questions</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You just want to bang her, you old goat!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Ay, m'hija, por favor</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Did someone forget to feed the goats?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> I have a chance of banging her long before you do</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Laughing and giving Hector a high-five) NICE</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Whatever, I just wish she'd high tail it back to Montana or wherever it is she came from</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> Montanans - bastards, all of them</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Dad, you're drooling on the chipotle</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> So, Craig, any new leads on what exactly happened that night at the museum?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Not really, since the necklace - most of it - was recovered... </p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Thanks to US</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> And, don't forget, Ms. McBride</p>
 
<div class="stage">Anita scowls at her uncle.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> It's technically out of our hands now - we're still doing spot checks for the statue but I am more than certain it's long gone</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Poor Lydia returned to work yesterday, she is just devastated by the whole thing</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> That woman should be fired!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Aren't you being a little harsh, Dad?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> They're just coddling her because of her condition - Carmie, butter me another roll... </p>
 
<div class="stage">Anita holds her mother's hand down as she reaches for the butter dish.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> AND because she's a WOMAN - if it were a healthy white man in her shoes, his ass would be tossed like a pizza</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> If it were a healthy white man in her shoes, I would hope he'd be wearing matching eye shadow</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (High-fiving Hector) Tapia scores again!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Unfortunately, there are those at the museum who feel the same way</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> What about you, Mom?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> It wasn't her fault, no one could've predicted what happened - besides, Lydia is my biggest supporter for enlarging the Chumash section, I don't want to lose her</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> DAMMIT, CARMIE, MY ROLL</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Holding her mother back again) GET... IT... YOUR... SELF</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> FINE</p>
 
<div class="stage">There is an awkward silence as everyone watches the older man struggle for the butter. After five minutes of listening to him grunt and groan, Anita reaches over and butters him a roll.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Here, spare us the drama</p>
 
<div class="stage">Ona Rosa's cell phone goes off and she eagerly answers it away from the table as everyone goes back to eating.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Returning) That was Javier, he'll be here shortly - do you mind if he brings Shelby and her son with him?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> Of course not, I'd love to have them, there's more than enough food!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> I DO NOT WANT THAT JIGABOO AT MY DINNER TABLE</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> SHH, the children might hear you!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> Francis, c'mon</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Geez, Dad, that's not right</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Look, I know the stroke addled half of your brain but THINK about what you're saying before you say it out loud!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Carmen</span> His internal editor is gone</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM - FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DAD, YOUR WIFE IS MEXICAN</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> She's not black!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> So, is she a wetback? - is Oni part spic? - what am I?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> You're just a big dyke but at least you have the decency not to bring your deviant whores to the dinner table</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Note to self: bring deviant whores over for tamales next Tuesday</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> Nita, don't exacerbate it</p>
 
<div class="stage">Carmen excuses herself from the table in tears.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hector</span> At the turn of the century, Francis, ITALIANS... along with people of Irish, Polish, and Chinese heritage, were considered to be the dregs of society</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Frank</span> SHUDDUP AND GET A REAL JOB</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'm 1/4 Estonian Jew, do I still get pie?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking at her pager) The pie, THANKFULLY, will have to wait - we're being called in on a Delta Code... let's move!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Jumping up) Ona Rosa, please thank your mother for me, dinner was enjoyable</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> It was?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> The food was</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Half smile) I'll save you some pie</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Oh, Captain, let's go!</p>

<div class="stage">At the KCON station breakroom, Morrigan is picking at some stale coffee cake with anchor Dan Henshaw.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES, COME ON - whatchy'all talking about?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Bird poop and flowers</p>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Chickenshit!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> That's actually good for legumes</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> Hey, Morey Eel, are you coming with to Techtonic? - Gracie promised me an all-disco set</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sorry, Dallas, I need to stay and finish editing my story on the county correctional program</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> Mmm, men behind bars, can I help?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Another time, maybe... please tell Gracie I'll catch her gig this weekend</p>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> They're having a Korean War retrospective on the History Channel tonight</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Austin</span> Aw damn, I forgot to set my VCR... LATER</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> You should set your VCR, you might LEARN something!</p>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What's up?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> That was Benitez, apparently, something is happening at the dock with a Meer-A-Mar ship, Kylee's too far out of range, you need to go cover it - we'll be doing a live stand-up in 20 minutes</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Jumping up) OH, GREAT</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> And just say no to urea!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Halting) Excuse me?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Dan</span> Never use urea-based nitrogen to feed African Violets, it gives them root burn</p>

<div class="stage">Craig and Anita thoroughly inspect the ship, along with the severely injured or dead crewmen.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Looks like our friend struck again</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Carefully looking at one of the broken pipes) Mm-hmm</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I really did enjoy dinner tonight, thank you for inviting me</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> You need to get out more</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'm serious - my family never spoke at dinner, my ex-wife only talked about herself at dinner - this was GREAT</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I'm glad someone enjoyed it</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You really should cut your father some slack - his judgment might be a little off but he's been through a lot</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> The stroke was 18 years ago, not 18 minutes ago - I am SICK and tired of people trying to excuse his horrific behavior and attitude on a tiny clot in his cerebrum</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You're lucky your father survived</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Am I?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Lieutenant!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Captain, don't make me replace you with a deviant whore at dinner next week</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Taking a long look around) Well, I think we've seen everything we need to see here, let's head on back</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Hold on... </p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> What?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Trying to retrace the footsteps in the attack pattern) There's something... something not right about this time</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> What do you mean? - it's the same MO</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah, but slightly different - it's like... it's like she was PRACTICING for something</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Coming up behind them) Practicing for what?</p>
