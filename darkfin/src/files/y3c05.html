<div class="stage">Inside the von Meer estate, everyone has left except for a few close 
 friends and family. Joe is helping Pauline make arrangements as KJ and 
 Ona Rosa watch from the kitchen.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> (Rubbing his shoulder) You know, KJ, you should lie 
 down and get some rest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Can't... I cannot even try to sleep right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> No one is talking about sleep</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I need to be here for my mom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> Joe is helping her and I'll do anything she asks</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Thank you, Oni</p>

<div class="stage">The two linger in a long hug.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> (Suddenly stepping away) Um... I was watching the 
 news</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I suppose they're looking for an official family statement 
 about dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> Um... yes - but I was watching it for Morrigan</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> DID THEY FIND HER?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> No... not yet</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Slamming his fist against the wall) GOD DAMMIT - this 
 is all just too insane - my girlfriend is being hunted by cops, my father...</p>

<div class="stage">He goes to wipe the tears from his eyes.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> (Handing him a tissue) I know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Oh, and judging by the broken dishes and crooked pictures 
 in the house, we had a nice little quake to go along with everything 
 else</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> It only caused minor damage</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> And your sister... dear God, she nearly died in a helicopter 
 crash!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> 'Nita is strong - it will take a lot more than that 
 to bring her down</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Why are you here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> What?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Why are you here with me instead of at home with your family... 
 your kids... Javier?</p>

<div class="stage">As she stumbles around for an answer, he moves closer to her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> It means everything that you wanted to be here with me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> (Trying to avoid eye contact) I just wanted to help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> You are</p>

<div class="stage">He bends in to kiss her on the lips. She hesitates at first but 
 allows it to happen. A second one follows in which Oni equally participates 
 in.</div>

<p a="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c05_kj_ona.jpg" h="506" w="510"></p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ona Rosa</span> (Pulling back) No...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> But...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Ona Rosa</span> My children need me... I've got to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Oni, wait!</p>

<div class="stage">She runs out of the house and KJ quickly follows. He is nearly knocked 
 over in the driveway by Griffin in his car.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> WATCH IT, MAN</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> GET IN THE CAR, KJ</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I can't leave mom at a time like this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> (Watching Ona Rosa take off) Looks like you were about 
 to do just that</p>

<div class="stage">KJ reluctantly gets in the passenger seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Where are we going?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> To work</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Are you serious? - I have to stay here and...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> And what? - stand around and mourn? - I really am 
 sorry about your father but the time for being your own man begins right 
 now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> You should talk</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Hey, I am the only one looking out for ALL of our 
 interests - do you see your sister around?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> She's not back with your mom yet?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> I don't know where they went, besides, that's the 
 least of our concerns - we have a critical PCOC board meeting and YOU 
 need to be there</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Dude, that's always been your call - why do you need me 
 there?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Because your father had a say in it as well - remember, 
 &quot;Meeramar&quot; as in &quot;von Meer&quot; AND &quot;Martel&quot;... 
 or, you could just sell us your family's half of the company and we'll 
 gladly change it to &quot;Martel Shipping&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Old Doug would just love that, wouldn't he?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Yes, my father certainly would - I'm sure that's his 
 primary goal right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Then why are you trying to help us?</p>

<div class="stage">The two look at each other.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Shaking his head) Look, I don't want to be some fucking 
 chess piece between your hatred for your dad and your love for my sister</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> This isn't about them - it's about having allies I 
 can trust to back me up when the time comes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> What the hell are you talking about? - what time? - you 
 make it sound like we're going to war</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> That's what business is - you're a lawyer, you should 
 know this!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Ugh... I am sorry, I'm trying to deal with all different 
 emotions right now, I can't think straight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> YOU NEED TO DO SO - granted, I am the one being groomed 
 to take over the business, and rightfully so, but I want you to be the 
 one representing the von Meers</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> My sister is better for this - dad thought so and I thought 
 you did too?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> She is a scientist, first and foremost - she sees 
 things in black and white - all environmental issues wouldn't stand 
 a chance against her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> Oh, I see - I'm just some dumbass meat puppet you can easily 
 control to help you rape nature, is that it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> THAT IS NOT IT AT ALL - YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT 
 - your background in law allows you to see all possibilities, we are 
 going to need that in the months ahead</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> WHAT IS THIS BIG THING THAT'S HAPPENING?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> You're about to find out, my friend</p>

<div class="stage">Moments later, the two pull into the corporate parking structure 
 and head for the main building. KJ hesitates as they walk towards the 
 executive boardroom.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> I'm not sure I'm up to this</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Griffin</span> Your sister isn't here - your father is dead - your 
 mother... please - do you want to call in your cousins from back east 
 to take over?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> A real man shines greatest in moments of true adversity 
 - you have your father's name... don't you think it's time you lived 
 up to it?</p>

<div class="stage">The two walk in to a large, darkened room with several non-PCOC 
 maps and charts highlighting the walls.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> KJ</span> (Swallowing hard as he looks around) I take it this isn't 
 a meeting about switching from winter to summer blends of gas?</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">After a long moment of silence in the Quartz Lake Inn wine cellar, 
 Morrigan breaks the hug and starts to question Erika.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I... I don't understand - what's going on with your 
 dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Someone tried to poison him</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I have every intention of finding out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Why did you bring him here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> It was the only safe place Stephanie and I could think 
 of</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> How did Hector Tapia become involved?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Are the &quot;when&quot; and &quot;where&quot; questions 
 next?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I'm sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> You never stop being a reporter, do you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Do you ever stop being a scientist?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Looking away) On occasion</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Well, you'll have to show me sometime</p>

<div class="stage">Erika stifles a laugh to herself.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Does KJ know he's alive?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No... and neither does my mother - they can't</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You can't even trust your own family?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> The less people who know means whoever did this can't 
 try it again</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> The anguish they must be going through!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> My father is still very critical - I don't want them 
 to go through his death twice</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan reaches out a hand of comfort to Erika but the von Meer 
 daughter rigidly refuses it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> (Noticing Morrigan's bandage) What happened to your 
 foot?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Just a cut</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Let me see</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> (Backing away) IT'S FINE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I don't want it to get infected</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Am... a friend took care of it - I need to leave</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Where are you going to go?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I don't know, but I can't stay here and risk the 
 police finding me AND your father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We're going to put him in a suite here - Joe will keep 
 quiet, no one will know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> That's great but...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> We can put you in an adjoining suite - you can look 
 after him for us!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I don't know</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> No, this is perfect - Steph needs to go back to work, 
 Hector wants out ASAP, Joe can't watch him every second and it will 
 give me a chance to find out what's going on</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Knowing exactly where both of you are and that you're 
 safe will be a huge comfort to me</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan raises an eyebrow.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> On behalf of my brother</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Of course</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Steph and I will show you what to do - you simply stay 
 in the room, Joe will take care of everything until we figure out what 
 the next move is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> You know, just in case you missed the APB, I am wanted 
 for murder - you're still willing to trust me with your dad?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I know you didn't kill that priest - I couldn't have 
 asked for a better person to take care of my father right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> Thank you... that means a lot</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> I'm just stating the obvious</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Morrigan</span> I... have a friend that's helping me - I wonder if 
 she'll she be able to find me?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Erika</span> Don't worry, I'm sure she will</p>

<p a="center"><img src="../assets/images/y3c05_joenne.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>

<div class="stage">After searching all over town for her sister, an exhausted Justine 
 returns to her apartment. A nervous Joenne cocks a submachine gun at 
 her head as she walks in.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> JESUS, JOIE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Putting down the weapon) Thank God it's you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> DO YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING 
 ON?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> No time... help me pack</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> PACK?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Throwing stuff in boxes) I've seen too much, I need 
 to go</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> Go where? - I have been looking for you all night 
 and day - Zach has been searching for Gracie - do you know where she 
 is? - how exactly are you involved with Morrigan's mess?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> McBride is just an aspect to it - I can't tell you 
 anymore right now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> (Wagging her finger) You BETTER tell me more because 
 this is complete bullsh...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Covering her mouth) You are my sister and I love you 
 - I know how much you want to be married with children someday, that's 
 why I want you to be safe - and why I have to leave at once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> It's too late for that - I know all about the creature 
 known as &quot;Father Greg&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> A-HA... I'll tell you my story IF you tell me yours!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> This is NOT a game, Justi!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Justine</span> Seems like a VERY big game to me - you can start off 
 by explaining why a temp secretary like you possesses a massive assault 
 weapon?</p>

<div class="stage">A large thud is heard outside of the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Joenne</span> (Pulling her sister) WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE, 
 NOW</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Walking along the bustling Duquesa Bay marina, Marcy chatters endlessly 
 while Anita half-heartedly nibbles at an ice-cream cone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> So, Tamarah calls me up the other day - she's a make-up 
 artist whose brother I helped get a crew job on Sig7 - we've all been 
 friends for years...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> That's nice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> Anyway, she keeps me on the phone for TWO hours complaining 
 about how she can't find a decent man</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> (Scuffing her sandals) Uh-huh</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> I'm like DUH - get the hell out of LA and what does 
 she do? - Anita, are you listening?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Listening, yes - caring, no</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> Well, TRY... for my sake</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> OK, what does she do?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> SHE MOVES TO FREAKING NEW YORK CITY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> (Shrugging her shoulders) And?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> AND? - COME ON, the only thing men in both LA and NYC 
 care about are who they can screw in business and in the bedroom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> And this comes from personal knowledge?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> It's like sand on asphalt - it looks secure but when 
 you go to step on it, you end up flat on your ass</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> With your legs spread wide open?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> Stop it</p>

<div class="stage">A couple of young fans spot Marcy and run over for autographs. She 
 reluctantly obliges and they walk off in smiles. A buff guy in trendy 
 shades and on roller blades whizzes by the two women and whistles his 
 appreciation at the attractive actress.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Funny... you have yet to sign my cast</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> (Winking) I gave you my personal autograph elsewhere</p>

<div class="stage">The guy on roller blades now circles back.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Guy</span> WOOOOO - BOGREE IS A HUMAN HOTTIE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> Thank you! - now, where was I... OH, so I tell Tamarah 
 that the only people these men are capable of loving are themselves 
 - if she wants the Holly Hobbie Good Housekeeping life, I told her to 
 try some mid-western shit state like Duluth</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Duluth is a city, not a state</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> You seem very uppity today, why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Nothing more sex wouldn't cure</p>

<div class="stage">The guy circles back again.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Guy</span> (Singing) LIFE'S LITTLE LESSONS - I HAVE A FEW LESSONS 
 I'D LIKE TO TEACH YOU, JAAAMIEEE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> SON OF A...</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> Just ignore him, it's par for the course - we'll take 
 care of the sex part later, why don't you try talking to me about what's 
 going on with you instead hiding behind this passive aggressive behavior?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> FINE - I get blown out of the sky last night and a mermaid 
 saves me from an evil band of hooded terrorists - HAPPY NOW?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> WOW - what pharmaceutical are you flipped on?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Why, want some?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Marcy</span> You know about my past - that's an extremely low shot, 
 even for you!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> Sorry... I'm really tired - tired of trying to fight 
 something I don't understand - tired of me and my CO getting suspended 
 for something we had no control over - tired of my loco family and the 
 drama that goes with them - tired of trying to separate myth from reality 
 - tired of fucking you for hours and then helping you pick out new swim 
 trunks for Ned - I'm tired of your het privilege while I'm the one who 
 endures the hate taunts - I'm tired of the chunks of cookie dough in 
 this ice cream...</p>

<div class="stage">The guy on roller blades returns for another pass at the two. This 
 time, Anita throws one solid punch with her cast-enforced arm into his 
 stomach. The guy is sent flying back and crumples down to the pavement, 
 trying to catch his breath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor"> Anita</span> (Grabbing her wrist) And I am REALLY tired of him!
