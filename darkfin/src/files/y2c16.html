<div class="stage">Inside his Meeramar office, which has been retrofitted with extra security measures, Griffin Martel speaks on his private phone to Erika.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> How are you doing this morning?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I can see clearly... out of one eye</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Do you want me to come over?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm fine, Rif, really - look, I am truly sorry about the accident, I'll have my father stop by the dealership and pick you out a new car later</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> That's really not necessary</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes, it is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Rikka, I own the dealership</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Ah... right</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I can pick it out myself - what I'm more interested in is why you didn't report the accident to the police when it happened?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I thought KJ explained it to you last night? - it was mostly my fault, I didn't want the insurance company hassle</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes, but now we have the complication of Morrigan McBride - have you seen the papers today?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> She did not shoot that priest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> They're investigating her as the main suspect</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> She's being set up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> How do you know?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's just a feeling I have</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> How very scientific of you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I working on the postulate this very moment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Once again, KJ's superlative dating selection is bringing a stench to the family - Morrigan has been nothing but a Samuel Beckett wet dream since she arrived in Duquesa Bay - stay away from her</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Any other orders, Sire?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Are you coming into the office today? - there is an exciting new development that I want to discuss with you... in person</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Listen, we're still on for that weekend in Napa but I just can't be bothered today - I have too many tests going at the lab</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Growing angry) Have Shelby do them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> She has her own to do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Shouting) YOU FUCKED UP MY CAR, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR THE BUSINESS... AND TO ME</p>

<div class="stage">There is a short silence on the phone.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You're about to have a meeting with your father, aren't you?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes, why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'll see what I can do later this afternoon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> We could have lunch</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Clicking off) Goodbye, Griffin</p>

<div class="stage">The middle Martel brother snaps his phone off and sighs. His large Samoan assistant knocks on the door.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> You may only enter if you bear good news</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> (Carrying a large wooden box and smiling) I believe it is, Sir</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Standing up) Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> (Setting it on the table) It just arrived by special messenger</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Eagerly opening it) Excellent!</p>

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c16_griffin_box.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">The two stare at the industrial-sized drill bit sitting in a velvet-lined compartment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Picking it up) I can't believe how light this is</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> The prototypes were most successful - not the exact same composition as what we're searching for but close enough to be of great assistance</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking at his watch) The timing couldn't have been better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> They have been mass-produced and the shipment is expected to arrive in a week's time</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Huh, we'll actually be ahead of schedule for once</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> They sent you this first one as a special gift</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I suppose we should give it an official designation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> Actually, Sir, they already have - the DM5</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Thinking for a minute) You've got to be kidding me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> It's the fifth and final version since this project began</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Gritting his teeth) &quot;DM?&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> (Looking away) Um... they named it after your father</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Putting it back in the box) Of course... I want this stored in my private vault, even with all of the new security measures, I do not feel comfortable keeping it here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Assistant</span> Shall I do it now?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Slamming it shut) In a few hours, I might as well show it to the man whose initials it bears</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">At the Duquesa Bay Yacht &amp; Polo Club, Douglas is preparing his horse for a practice match with a few business associates.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Putting out a cigar) I'm telling you, Collins, this new first baseman we just signed is pure money - he can barely speak English but who the hell can these days?

<div class="stage">The group of men chuckle as a call from Griffin rings through to Doug on his cell.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Sighing and answering it) What's the problem now, son?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> No problem, father - in fact, I think you're going to be please with what I have...
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> This will have to wait until I get back to the office, I'm busy
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> But
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I'll see you in a couple of hours

<div class="stage">The Martel patriarch stuffs the phone in his gear bag and shakes his head.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Christ, you would think that with four sons at least ONE of them would have my backbone
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Collins</span> What about your daughter?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> What about her?

<div class="stage">Collins blinks.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Oh, well Vikki is quite capable... for a girl - but she has her place on the bench
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Collins</span> Heh, true - we are going to need her shortly - but I do think that Griffin is doing a good enough job
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> &quot;Good enough&quot; does not cut it in my book - he has a lot more to learn - now, Bradley has the balls but he's too busy thinking with them right now
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Collins</span> There's no hope for Ben?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Scowling) No - the last shred was snuffed out when he married KCON's queen dom and became &quot;Mr. Claudia Steel&quot;
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Collins</span> (Shrugging) Well, there's always baby Ivan
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Nah, I can tell already that he's going to be high maintenance like his mother - just by the way he craps his diapers
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Collins</span> (Raising an eyebrow) That's a unique paradigm

<div class="stage">Doug suddenly notices a man loitering at the far end of the field.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Recognizing him) Um, gentlemen, you all go on ahead 
 - there's a matter I need to take care of real quick

<div class="stage">He saunters over to the man with large ears and the 
 two take a walk over to a secluded area.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> You must have something for me to show up here
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man</span> Sure do, Mr. M - I'm not sure you're gonna like it much
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Squinting) I doubt I'll like it at all - hand it over

<div class="stage">The man gives him a small video camera with a playback monitor.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Getting frustrated with the buttons) How do you work this asinine thing?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man</span> Uh... here, allow me

<div class="stage">The man switches on the player and Doug watches images of Ursula, wearing nothing but Captain Phelps' unbuttoned uniform shirt, sitting astride a naked Craig, flash by. After a moment, he silently places the viewer on top of a small slate wall and takes his mallet to it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Smashing it to bits) HOW DARE YOU - I SAVED YOU - I MADE YOU - YOU ARE THE MOTHER OF MY SON

<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c16_doug.jpg" h="435" w="470"  b="0"/>


<div class="stage">He pauses to catch his breath.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man</span> They'll be meeting at his place later - so... do you want me to fix this little problem?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Walking through the pieces of the player) NO - there are some matters a man needs to handle himself
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man</span> Right - about my fee?

<div class="stage">Douglas whips around with the mallet still in his hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man</span> (Backing off) Ooh, you know, just... uh, just send it on in to the office - and if there's anything else I can help with
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Get lost... NOW

<div class="stage">The man does as he is told while Martel returns to his associates.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Collins</span> Everything alright?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Yes - perfect - but I need to take care of some business, please go on without me
<hr>

<div class="stage">As Griffin prepares to go before a hastily called meeting of the Pacific Coast Oil Cartel, Erika shows up at his office.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (All smiles) You decided to take me up on my lunch offer?

<div class="stage">Erika tosses him a sack containing two salads to go.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking a seat) Let's get down to business - what was so important that you guilt tripped me into coming over?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Gesturing to the box) I have something inside here that's going to floor you
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Adjusting her extra pair of glasses) Not another &quot;dildo in the magic box&quot; gag
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Evil grin) I nearly killed Sister Marie Sabine with that in Ghent
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Are we here to reminisce?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Actually, what's in this box will astonish even you, dear - I'm getting ready to present it to the board but I wanted you to see it first... actually, I wanted my father to see it first but he's not here
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> And I am... lucky me

<div class="stage">Griffin opens the box with a flourish and takes out the drill bit.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That actually looks painful
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> It goes on the end of an industrial drill
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Unimpressed) Was there a sale at SEARS?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> The DM5 is the state-of-the-art tool we'll be using for our next project
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> DM5?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Just some silly title designation - here, you're the scientist, have a look!

<div class="stage">He presents it to a suddenly piqued Erika who can't help but notice how similar it is to Nereidium.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> This... this metal is so light - what is it?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> It's some kind of alloy our R&amp;D team came up with - it's not exactly what we were hoping for but it should get the job done
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Why do I have the feeling that you're going to be drilling for more than oil?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Hesitant) Well... yes, I guess you could assume that
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What is it?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I can't really say at the moment except that the metal we're going after will make this drill bit seem like talcum powder compared to pure cocaine
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Trying to remain cool) That's a pretty boastful claim - as a scientist, I am extremely skeptical until there have been numerous studies to back up those words
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Believe me, once we tap this vein, there will be no need for studies - this is a natural resource that will revolutionize the world with its industrial applications
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Don't you mean military?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Taking the bit and putting it back inside the box) The military IS an industry, Erika

<div class="stage">The von Meer daughter studies a beaming Griffin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> IF all goes according to plan - one thing I have learned over the course of my experiments is that you can never predict unknown variables
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> There will be no unknown variables - if there are, we'll simply eliminate them... in fact, one is already out of the way

<div class="stage">Before she can respond, Douglas barges in.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> OK, what's so important, Griffin?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I was just showing Erika and now I'm about to show it to the PCOC board
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Going right over to the box) Is this what we've been waiting for?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes... the DM5
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Throwing open the box and checking out the bit) Huh, they named it after me, that's the least they could do with all the money I've spent on this venture
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Sour expression) We could send it back and wait for your image to be engraved on it?

<div class="stage">Erika turns aside to stifle a laugh.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Is everyone gathered?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Yes, they're waiting in Conference Room 4
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Gingerly putting it back in the box) Fine, give me your notes and let's go
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Notes? - but I'm giving the presentation
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Heading out the door) Not anymore - come on, get a move on, I have to be somewhere shortly
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Looking at Erika and then to his father) WHY DON'T YOU GO THERE NOW? - I HAVE THIS UNDER CONTROL
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> I'm sure you do, son, but this is much too important for you to screw up in the slightest way
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Douglas, why don't you let Griffin give the presentation? - if I remember correctly, the last presentation YOU gave resulted in half of the room falling asleep while the remainder either cracked jokes or picked their noses?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Cocky smile) Is this the official von Meer family stance, Erika - since I don't see your father or brother participating in this?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Strutting past him and out of the room) They have better things to do... as do I

<div class="stage">The two Martel men watch as she slams the door behind her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> Jesus, boy, you let a woman fight your battles for you?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Am I giving the presentation or not?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> C'mon - we'll both do it
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Huffing) Fine

<div class="stage">As he starts to walk off, his father grabs his shoulder.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Nodding back to the box) Aren't you forgetting something?

<div class="stage">Griffin glares at his father, grabs up the box, and rushes out. Doug now receives a call on his cell from Ursula.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> (Gritting his teeth) Hello, Legs - yes, I'm on my way to a meeting - it looks like I'll be busy all night... right... love you too
<hr>

<div class="stage">Outside on his condo patio, Captain Phelps barbecues some steaks while a naked Ursula relaxes in the hot tub.</div>


<img class="add-modal"   src="assets/images/y2c16_craig.jpg" h="457" w="520"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You know, we've been seeing each other for weeks now and I have no idea how you like your meat cooked?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Finishing a margarita) Craigy, we are just having sex, please don't turn it into anything more than that
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Um, so do I take that as a &quot;well done?&quot;
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> As long as you serve it with mushrooms, I will be happy

<div class="stage">Craig thinks for a moment and then dashes into the kitchen where he quickly picks some mushroom slices off of a pizza in the fridge.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Back in Montenegro, my Papa grew the best mushrooms, they were the pride of our village - last week at this Sigma 7 charity event, we had to chase these shiny bald cancer kids around giant paper mache day-glo colored mushrooms - haven't these poor children suffered enough I thought?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Returning to the patio) I'm sorry, I missed what you said
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> How fortunate for you - really - I love it here, it's so humble and peaceful
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Opening himself a Diet Coke) Thanks... I think - actually, it won't be very peaceful starting next weekend, I'll have my daughter for a whole month while the ex goes off on some new age spiritual retreat
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> This better not interfere with our rendezvous
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> We'll figure it out but I do want you to meet my little girl
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Sighing) I already have one child I've pawned off on nannies, what's one more?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> She's a big fan of your show
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> I am NOT wearing the R'xal costume
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Flipping over the steaks) Don't worry, &quot;Bogree&quot; is her favorite
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> WHAT?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Only because she watches &quot;Life's Little Lessons&quot; all the time on The Rerun Network
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Grimacing) Marcy... MARCY, MARCY, MARCY - heh, maybe if I had anglicized MY name, the public would be more adoring
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Marcy Nolan is not her real name?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Try &quot;Marta Noliakas&quot;... and she has to have her moustache waxed once a month
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Ooh, I wonder if Fiore is aware of that?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Who is Fiore?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> My lieutenant - a new suitor of your co-star
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> Tell him not to waste his time, she has a finace
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> You have a husband
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> I see, it's OK for him to screw around but not me?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That's not the point - and, besides... it's not &quot;he&quot; - it's &quot;she&quot;... Anita Fiore
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Jumping out of the tub) Is this true?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Finishing up the dinner) It's all I hear out of her mouth besides Dark... er, work
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Hugging Craig) Wonderful - I have some new leverage now
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Like your husband being the executive producer isn't enough of an 800 lb. gorilla?
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ursula</span> (Now kissing Craig) Gorilla... how apt... make love to me
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> But the steaks are done?

<div class="stage">Ursula pushes the plates aside and the two stumble back into the hot tub. A loud thump is heard from the other side of the wall as Doug comes crashing through the bushes with his mallet in hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Doug</span> YOU'RE GONNA BE DONE NEXT, PHELPS - AND THIS TIME, NOT BY MY WIFE</p>
