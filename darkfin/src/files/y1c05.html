      <p>All the principles rush to the train accident. As the authorities bicker and delay a response, Darkfin decides to ignite the oil slick before it can hit the bay. Meanwhile Morrigan spots a man in the wreckage and goes to help him. Darkfin charges her trident and throws it into the oil causing a huge fireball...</p>

<div class="stage">Just past the intersection of Riverbank Drive and the 101, total chaos surrounds the scene as emergency personnel try to cordon off the area from onlookers. Six of the train's 17 cars are completely engulfed in flames as two others teeter precariously on the side of the bridge. A huge plume of oily dark smoke rises into the sky. The KCON news van arrives with the rest of the media.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking at the madness before her) Dear God!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Speaking to the station) BENNY, ARE YOU GUYS READY OVER THERE? - WE'LL BE GOING LIVE IN TWO MINUTES... START THE COUNT</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan heads for a police officer as Gracie sets up the shot.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">MM</span> OFFICER, OFFICER... could you please tell us what happened here?</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="451" w="330" src="assets/images/train_wreck_fire.jpg" a="center" alt="The wreck burns... "/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cop</span> Sorry Ma'am, you're going to have to wait for our Public Information Officer just like everyone else</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Can you at least tell me if there have been any deaths?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cop</span> There have been fatalities - again, you'll have to wait for more details... now, I'm going to have to ask you two ladies to step back</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thank you, officer</p>

<div class="stage">Zach comes rushing over.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I just talked to one of my fireman buddies - they're going to start evacuating 10 square blocks of the surrounding area because of toxic smoke and fumes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Great, I just had the van washed!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How bad is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> He said he particulate level is not that bad... yet - if this thing gets any bigger, people's lungs are going to be doing the &quot;Benzene Boogie&quot;</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Morri, get ready</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Into her mike) CHECK, CHECK... 1, 2... CHECK - they're not getting me, Gracie</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Banging on some equipment) There's too much interference for audio but the vid feed is fine - get on the cell to the talking heads and give them all of your info, they're just going to have to read over the shot!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Dialing the cell phone) If we move back about 100 yards, we might get some clearance</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, but the studio wants me in as tight as possible on the shot</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No doubt - let me talk to the anchors and then I'll go find the DIS-information guy... let me know when we have audio</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Will do!</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin swims effortlessly up the river towards the spill, cutting through the water at upwards of 70 knots. Her sonic signature warns off the marine life in the area, clearing the river of fish. As she approaches the site, she can &quot;taste&quot; the change in the water. She stealthily rises from the water, concealed among some reeds and surveys the situation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I'm getting really tired of this</p>

<div class="stage">Piloting a USCG helicopter, Lt. Fiore flies over the scene with Captain Phelps next to her, barking orders into his radio.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I WANT ALL WATERCRAFT OUT OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA, GET SOME TEAMS DOWN HERE TO START A CONTAINMENT BOOM AROUND THE OIL</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking down below) NOTHING is going to contain that shit!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Turning off his radio) SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER, FIORE, SO SOME ASSHOLE WITH A SCANNER CAN PICK UP THAT EXACT QUOTE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Sorry - do you want me to go in closer?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Nah, I can see all I need to see - remain at this level, we can coordinate better with this vantage point</p>

<div class="stage">Hidden below, Darkfin holds up her middle finger to the air.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking out at the rising smoke and growing oil slick) The wind speed is low, the spill is fresh and the water current is less than a knot... we have perfect conditions for an in-situ burn!</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="248" w="236" src="assets/images/anita_headshot.gif" a="center" alt="Lt. Anita Fiore"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> There's a nearby residential area southeast of here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> The wind isn't blowing in that direction</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> For now</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> The conditions aren't going to get any better</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Fine, Anita, go ahead and click the red tape scissors shoes three times - let's see what happens</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Dammit, Craig, time is of the essence!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> There are too many variables and we need the Federal and State On-Scene Coordinators' permission with a residential area so close by</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> IT'S THE FREAKING WEEKEND, THEY WON'T BE HERE FOR HOURS</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That's not our fault, is it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Slamming her hand down on the panel) This is Alaskan North Slope Crude Oil, once it hits the bay, we're going to have another Exxon Valdez on our hands - it will take YEARS to clean up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">CP</span> At least someone will be getting an employment opportunity out of it</p>

<img class="add-modal"    b="0" h="235" w="235" src="assets/images/craig_headshot.gif" a="center" alt="Capt. Craig Phelps"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> HOW CAN YOU BE SO CAVALIER? - think of what it'll cost the people living here!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> THINK of our CAREERS going up in FLAMES if one person so much as COUGHS because of the fire WE set</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Save a few people... or an entire ecosystem - I say we choose the latter</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> NOW who is the one being cavalier? - you've been hanging around your brother-in-law too much!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> At least Sandy, Shelby and Erika are trying to figure out ways to help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Well, unless those science wizards are down there with magic wands, there's nothing any of us can do at this point</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Clutching her trident and watching the slick spread towards the faster currents of the river) What are these fools waiting for, LIGHT IT</p>

<div class="stage">Calculating in her head and gauging the surrounding factors, Darkfin looks at the train.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Just the right angle</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">On a cliff overhead, Morrigan and Zach question the Information Officer as the evening sky is obscured by flame and smoke.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Info Officer</span> At this point, we can't rule out sabotage but we have no conclusive evidence yet and no further comment</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> But one witness said there was a small explosion BEFORE the train derailed</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Info Officer</span> We have no confirmation of that yet - we're looking into faulty tracks, as well as, human error - it will take awhile before we know for sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> At this time, there are two dead and three injured - all crew members of the train?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Info Officer</span> That is correct</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Most of the cargo is from Meer-A-Mar Shipping, when can we expect to talk with them?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Info Officer</span> They are helping set up a command center and will have a statement for you within the hour</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> How is the evacuation going?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Info Officer</span> Smoothly - a few people have been treated at local hospitals for smoke inhalation - but, as long as the wind continues to blow to the northwest, we don't foresee a problem</p>

<div class="stage">Out of the corner of her eye, Morrigan notices something in one of the wrecked cars by the bridge.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Excuse me, I'll be right back</p>

<div class="stage">The young reporter snakes her way around the confusion and tries to get a closer look. Zach trails behind her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> McBride, what are you doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Making her way down a side embankment) I think... IT IS... IT'S A MAN... HE'S TRAPPED BEHIND THE CAR</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> I'LL GO FOR HELP</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Now inching along the bridge towards the man) THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT, THIS WHOLE BRIDGE IS ABOUT TO GO UP IN FLAMES</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> DON'T DO IT, HE'S PROBABLY ALREADY DEAD</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> WHAT IF HE ISN'T?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> (Now following cautiously behind her) FIRST RULE OF JOURNALISM, NEVER BE PART OF THE STORY</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> FIRST RULE OF HUMANITY, ALWAYS HELP OTHERS</p>

<div class="stage">As Gracie pans the scene with her camera, she notices Morrigan and Zach.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Zooming in) NO... NONONONO, WHAT IN THE HELL ARE THEY DOING?</p>

<div class="stage">Above, in the helicopter, Anita and Craig also spot the situation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Screaming into his radio) WE'VE GOT CIVILIANS ON THE BRIDGE, GET THEM OUT OF THERE</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Flying in closer) IT LOOKS LIKE ISAACSON AND MCBRIDE... CHRIST ALMIGHTY</p>

<div class="stage">With trident in hand, Darkfin takes a deep breath and positions herself carefully.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> It will still be a mess, but at least it's a mess that can be handled</p>

<div class="stage">The two reporters reach the man and start to carry him to safety. As they near the edge of the bridge, the man chokes and gasps.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Man</span> Ahhgh... Pete... he's still inside... HELP HIM</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan takes off back to the car, towards the smoke and flames.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Zach</span> DON'T DO IT, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Watching through the camera lens) WHY IS SHE GOING BACK?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (From the helicopter) JESUS, SHE'S GOING BACK</p>

<div class="stage">Darkfin bangs the bottom of her trident down hard on a rock to activate the charge. She prepares to throw it.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> Time's up</p>

<div class="stage">Inside the car, Morrigan looks frantically for another man.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> PETE... PETE... CAN YOU HEAR ME?</p>

<div class="stage">A small whimper is heard over the increasing roar of the flames. The woman finds a frightened Border Collie crawling towards her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Pete? - C'MON BOY, IT'S OK, C'MON</p>

<div class="stage">Grabbing the dog in her arms, Morrigan starts to run as fast as she can. Before she makes it off the bridge, everything in back of her explodes into flames.</div>
