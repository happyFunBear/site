<div class="stage">Inside a darkened boardroom, several unseen, seated members chat amongst themselves as a large, topographical map of Duquesa Bay is illuminated on a screen before them. Griffin Martel enters the room and stands at the head of the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I apologize for being late, I just received some very positive news that I wish to share... we had a major breakthrough in our R&amp;D technology</p>
<div class="stage">He quickly distributes folders around the table and begins a short software presentation.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I have the utmost confidence that drilling will commence within a year's time</p>
<div class="stage">The room is abuzz with pleased commentary. Only seen by his hand holding a cigar, a man silences everyone and turns his attention to Griffin.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cigar Man</span> That is indeed encouraging news, however, we have experienced some... incidents over the last few months - incidents that were not entirely cleaned up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Lowing his head) I am aware of the situation, yes</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cigar Man</span> And at the heart of these incidents is a KCON reporter by the name of Morrigan McBride</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c04_griffin_pcoc.jpg" h="501" w="320"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I will be speaking with her shortly, I can assure you, Sir, that she will not be a further problem</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cigar Man</span> We'll see about that</p>

<div class="stage">A female voice, marked with a Southeast Asian accent, chimes in.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Woman's voice</span> What about the Coast Guard?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Steps are being taken to make sure that their efforts are fruitless</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cigar Man</span> Those steps should have already been in place, Mr. Martel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Trying not to get ruffled) They ARE in place, Sir, we're just reinforcing them</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Woman's Voice</span> Our contact in the UK should have the information we've requested by tonight</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cigar Man</span> Excellent... anything else?</p>

<div class="stage">The room is quiet as Griffin takes a seat.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Cigar Man</span> Well then, let's get down to our regular business.</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">Inside the opulent lobby of the Del Pilar, one of Duquesa Bay's most prestigious hotels, Morrigan McBride calmly waits for Griffin Martel to finish with the Pacific Coast Oil Cartel conference. She reviews a few of her notes, unconcerned with the bustling people around her until she feels a presence directly behind her back.</div>

<img  src="assets/images/del_pilar.jpg" h="122" w="294"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Quickly turning around) Can I help you?</p>

<div class="stage">Erika von Meer, dressed in a formal business suit, stares down at her.</div>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c04_erika_business.jpg" h="506" w="320"  b="0" a="center"/>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Griffin Martel will never answer those questions to your satisfaction</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Slamming her notebook shut) Dr. von Meer, might I ask what you are doing?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You might... my family has business interests with the PCOC, my father is out of town and wanted me to sit in on the meeting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Now standing) No - what are you doing looking at my notes?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Oh, simple curiosity I suppose</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Keep it at the lab</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I apologize if I violated your privacy but it does not change my initial response - Griffin will not give you an honest answer to any of those questions</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> And why would that be?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You're a journalist, figure it out</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I will</p>

<div class="stage">The two stare at each other for a moment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The meeting started over 20 minutes ago, instead of standing out here, being all cryptic with me, maybe you should go inside?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I'm not concerned, KJ will catch me up</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Surprised) Your brother is here?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Yes, my sentiments exactly - today, he decided to become responsible and attend to Meeramar concerns</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking around) I didn't see him go in</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> He was here earlier</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hmm</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> If you'd like, why don't you join us for dinner tonight? - Griffin has cornered me into dining with him at the club</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> The club?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> The Duquesa Bay Yacht and Polo Club</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ah right, which I am not a member of... sorry</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> KJ can come along, you'll be our invited guest</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's nice of you but I'm not really into foursomes - I can barley handle playing pinochle with my friends</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What if I assisted you in getting the responses you seek out of Griffin?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Heh, what are you going to do, drug his drink?</p>

<div class="stage">The tall blonde flashes a smirk.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh my God, are you really going to drug his drink?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Actually, I am going to rely on your expert intuitive abilities as a journalist to flourish under a relaxed social setting</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh... OK, sure</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Or, you could simply wait here for another few hours, these meetings do tend to drag on so</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I do need to get back to the station</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Tonight at 8:00 then?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Fine, I'll see you there</p>

<div class="stage">The petite brunette watches Dr. von Meer head into the conference room.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Thanks... I think</p>

<hr>

<div class="stage">That evening, seated at a private booth inside the club, Griffin and Erika share a bottle of champagne while waiting for KJ and Morrigan to arrive.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Honestly, Rikka, I don't know why we couldn't have spent the evening alone together?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Raising an eyebrow) Come, Rif, you're always hounding me about being more social - this should please you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Draining his glass) I'm thinking of other ways you could please me</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> You have Ms. Shepperton for that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Kylee is a whore and nothing more - perhaps you enjoy living the life of a monk, I do not</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Smirking) Who says I am?</p>

<div class="stage">Girffin looks horrified as KJ bounds over to the table.</div>


<img  src="assets/images/y2c04_kj_happy.jpg" h="435" w="295"  b="0"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Kissing Erika on the cheek) Hey, Sis</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Kage, where is Ms. McBride?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> She just called and said she was on her way from the station... thanks, by the way</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> For what?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> For setting this up, she has been dodging me all week</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Really?</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin sighs and looks at his watch.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> It's kinda strange... Dad saw her strolling along the beach all by herself last night</p>
<div class="stage">Erika thinks for a moment as Griffin pours himself another drink.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I have an idea, after some appetizers, why don't you take her to another table for some privacy, KJ?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Pointing) Excellent idea, Grif, thanks!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I thought you needed to give Ms. McBride an interview?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> And I was all set to do just that after the conference until YOU suggested we all meet for dinner</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I am only trying to help</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Leaning back in his seat) And how exactly is that?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> If she is in a social setting, she might not be as... sharp on her questions</p>

<div class="stage">Martel considers this for a moment as the waiter brings them an appetizer assortment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> She has a strong point there - you know, Rik, I could use you in the courtroom</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Assisting with father's business is more than enough, thank you</p>

<div class="stage">A shocked expression washes over KJ's face, causing both Griffin and Erika to turn around. Dressed in a stunning magenta cocktail dress, Morrigan slowly approaches their table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Standing up) WOW</p>

<img  src="assets/images/y2c04_morrigan.jpg" h="548" w="320"  b="0" a="center"/>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Following the other man's lead) She cleans up rather well</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Eyeing the woman) Indeed, she does</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking a seat) I hope I'm not too late</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Wide grin) Not at all - you look really hot!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Kissing her hand) What Mr. von Meer truly means is that you are a splendid vision of radiance, Ms. McBride</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Trying not to blush) Thank you, Mr. Martel</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That really isn't your color</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone looks at Erika with slight astonishment.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I believe green is more suited to you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) That's what my mother said</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Wise woman</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Yes, she was</p>

<div class="stage">The dinner progresses on with polite conversation and delicious food. Morrigan peppers both Griffin and KJ about PCOC and Meeramar business matters but tempers her questions to appear innocuous. She slyly observes Griffin's interaction with KJ and listens carefully to their responses as a few businessmen come over to the table and greet them. As they leave, Erika smiles to herself until she observes Morrigan shivering.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Feeling the other woman's exceedingly warm arm) Are you cold?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking a deep breath) It's only the chills, I think I have a touch of something</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Ooh, that reminds me of the time when we were all in Zermatt for New Year's and mom had that projectile vomiting thing</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Scowling at Erika) A perfect topic of conversation</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Do you ski, Morri?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not really, I went to Mammoth Lakes once with my dad's side of the family and hated it - I had more fun making snowmen with icicles protruding from inappropriate places</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> HA - Frosty the Boneman!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Clever</p>

<div class="stage">Griffin sighs in disgust.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Although I love skiing, I'm more of a Spring man myself... hiking in the hills when everything is just beginning to bloom - you can't beat it!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> I disagree with that statement, counselor - nothing can compare to the vibrant death of Autumn</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> That's very poetic, Griffin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> And I've only had two glasses of champagne</p>

<div class="stage">Everyone fake laughs.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Patting Erika's back) Sis here is a Summer Girl - loves her bikinis and the water!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Refilling his glass) I'll drink to that!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Hey, we'll all have to go out for a sail soon while the weather is still nice</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What about you, Morrigan, which one of us do you agree with?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Actually... none - my love has always been for Winter - back in Montana, on moonlit nights, I would take long walks in the fresh snow, lie down in a drift and look up at all of the gleaming stars, enjoying the cool, crisp stillness of it all - I have never felt more at peace in my entire life</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Half smile) Now who is being poetic?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I am DEFINITELY taking you to Tahoe this year!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Do you miss Montana?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> At times, but I'm glad I'm here</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not sure yet</p>

<div class="stage">KJ suddenly spots Dr. Sanchez and his wife, Ona Rosa, being seated on the patio.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Oh, would you all excuse me for just a moment, I need to say hi to someone</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking past them out to sea) No problem, I need to use the restroom</p>

<div class="stage">The woman quickly jumps up from the table.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Throwing his napkin on the table) Well, wasn't this a romantic evening - you owe me, Rikka!</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Softly twirling her dessert fork around two fingers) Did Morrigan not toss puffball questions to you about PCOC?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> True, but I would have preferred her hardball questions earlier if it meant having an evening alone with you</p>

<div class="stage">Erika can't help but smile a little bit as he kisses her hand.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> Now, if you'll excuse me, I still have some business matters to deal with - tell KJ I'll see him tomorrow and if Ms. McBride has any further questions, please have her contact me at the office</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Will do</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> And I'll see you for dinner, ALONE, this Friday</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Griffin</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Griffin</span> (Sauntering away) This Friday, Erika, no arguments</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> For now</p>

<div class="stage">After running her hands under cold water and wiping her head with a wet paper towel, Morrigan jots down some notes in her purse concerning Griffin's responses to her PCOC questions. As she goes to leave, Erika enters.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I suppose it's not the same unless we literally run into each other somehow</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Noticing Morrigan's extra pale appearance) Are you still not feeling well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Not particularly, thank you for a wonderful evening though... please let me get my share of the bill</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Please do not concern yourself with that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I do concern myself with that</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Three multi-millionaires were present at your table this evening</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Look, just because I'm a journalist getting paid peanuts doesn't mean I can't take care of a bill</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> The champagne we drank alone was five-hundred dollars</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ah</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Cocking her head) A glass</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> OK, maybe I need to smile and say thank you</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Softening her expression) Tell me, were you able to find the answers you were seeking tonight?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Indirectly, I now have more leads than I would have by asking Mr. Martel outright... those businessmen he spoke with earlier, they were from a Meeramar subsidiary in Alaska, correct?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> How astute</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> They are overflowing with oil up there, it's not like PCOC needs to drill for any more down here... especially in an area that's filled with ardent environmentalists and Indian burial grounds</p>

<div class="stage">Morrigan watches in the mirror as Erika slowly paces in back of her.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Fixing her hair) Thank you for setting this evening up, Dr. von Meer</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I enjoyed myself</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why did you do it?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I have my reasons</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Half smile) I'm sure you do... and I'll figure those out later - please tell your brother I would love to take him up on his offer of a sail soon</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Why don't you tell him yourself?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I need to get going</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Working late at the station?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Hesitant) I'm waiting for someone - goodnight</p>

<div class="stage">The von Meer daughter holds the door open as Morrigan looks at her watch and rushes out.</div>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Goodnight, Ms. McBride</p>
