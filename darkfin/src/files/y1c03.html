  <h1>Year 1, Chapter 3</h1><h2>&quot;Timing&quot;</h2>
 
 
<div class="stage">In the second floor Santa Conchita apartment of Gracie Takanachi, Morrigan McBride is tossing and turning on a lemon-yellow futon with her legs tangling up in a Seattle Seahawks throw blanket.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Thrashing about) No... NO</p>
 
 
<div class="stage"><img border="0" height="387" width="144" src="../assets/images/tiki.gif" alt="Tiki Mask" align="right">The woman wakes herself and sits up quickly, brushing strands of unruly light-brown hair out of her eyes. She is surrounded by walls of top-of-the-line electronic equipment and tiki masks.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Looking around) Where does the last nightmare end and the new one begin?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Coming up behind her) Don't care for the decor, eh?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Oh, no... it's fine... I just</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">The pudgy, almond-eyed woman tosses her a bottle of water.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Morri, if we're to work together as a team, as well as be friends, you always need to be honest with me, no matter what</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Twisting the cap off) Sounds like a deal... your place sucks... better?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Much</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I mean, it's just not my style but if it works for you... </p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> There's no need to patronizing - by the way, you can find potpourri and lace in the bathroom</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Pulling the blanket off) Now who's patronizing?</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">Gracie lets out a quick laugh as Morrigan gulps down her water.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Picking up the blanket from the floor) That must've been some dream</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Serious tone) It was a tocsin</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Excuse me, a what? - a poison?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Getting up and looking out the window) A portent... an augury... an omen</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Is this where a little boy shows up on my doorstep with &quot;666&quot; on his head?</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">Still staring out the window, the pale skinned McBride turns even whiter and does not respond to the joke. Silence fills the room for a moment.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> They only happen to me before a life-altering event - sometimes good, most times... bad</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Trying not to freak) Um, okay... what did you see?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> A hand... a green hand... reaching up from the water</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Ah, that's easy - those dead guys from this morning have you creeped out</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No... this was not the hand of a corpse, I've seen dead hands before... this one was very much alive</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">Subconsciously pulling at her own dark hair for comfort, Takanachi is at a loss for words.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><img border="0" height="337" width="200" src="../assets/images/dream_hand.gif" align="right" alt="Morrigan's Dream">MM</span> (Looking down at her hands) They... didn't seem completely human - they had... things... on them</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Reaching in a drawer for something) &quot;Things&quot; as in markings, growths, missing fingers?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Oreo cookies?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> This is not a joke</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Holding up a package) I'm OFFERING you some cookies</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Turning around and taking some) Thanks - my parents would fix me a plate of milk and cookies after I woke up from one of these things</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I guess I should be grateful for only having crazy sex nightmares</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> For as long as I can remember, I've had these &quot;P-dreams&quot; about one strange thing or another</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> &quot;P&quot; as in &quot;premonition?&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> No, &quot;P&quot; as in I pee my pants</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Well, I'm glad my cushion is already yellow</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Don't worry, I woke up before that happened</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I think I need a smoke, I think you need a smoke, too</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't smoke cigarettes</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Forget cigarettes, I've got something stronger in mind</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Giving her a disparaging look) That's not going to change anything</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Listen, you are completely fatigued - you've been on the road for the last few days, eating fast-food, not getting enough sleep and being forced to work the minute you get into town - of course your brain is going to play some nasty tricks on you!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> It doesn't come from my brain</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> ALRIGHTY THEN</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Cramming two cookies in her mouth) But, now that you've mentioned it, a decent meal wouldn't hurt</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Do you like mayonnaise?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Uh... when it's ON a sandwich</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Damn you, picky bitch!</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">Morrigan picks up a framed photo of Gracie at her college graduation, standing between her parents and brother.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> What a great image - such detail!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Now sitting across from Morrigan) My ex-husband shot that - it was the only nice thing he ever gave me</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Did you two meet at school?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Yeah, we had the same photography classes - it was your traditional drunken Vegas wedding, the marriage only lasted six months - we mainly did it to piss off our folks... HOW DARE YOU MARRY A WHITE MAN/HOW DARE YOU MARRY A JAP GIRL</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Did you two love each other?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Oh sure - we still do, but we went in different directions - he prefers still shots on film, I prefer live shots on video... anyway, his life is one big paid vacation... and you can see what mine is</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Where does he work? - can I get a job there?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Jack Stacey is National Geographic's favorite &quot;flash man&quot; - as for a job there, stand in line!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Wait a minute, for six months... you were &quot;Gracie Stacey?&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Another reason we got hitched!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Ha</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> Look at the time - all of this bonding over my ex and your freaky dreams is fun, but we need to get a move on</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Stuffing one last cookie in her mouth) Mmm</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> (Packing some gear) We'll get something good to eat after the press conference</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Hey, we need to go over to KJ's house and get my stuff</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Gracie</span> I totally forgot that today is KJ's polo practice day, he won't be back there until later tonight - if at all - and I, quite frankly, don't feel like dealing with any of his lame family members - he has the trailer in his garage, we'll get it tomorrow, I promise</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Grabbing her purse) Alright, let's roll</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">The two of them walk out the door and down the stairs.</div>

 
<bar></bar>
 <p><img border="0" height="159" width="160" src="../assets/images/coast_guard_logo.gif" alt="Coast Guard Logo"></p>
 
 
 
<div class="stage">Inside the Coast Guard's field office at Santa Conchita City Hall, <a href="../people.html#phelps">Captain Craig Phelps</a>, a tan, well-built man and <a href="../people.html#anita">Lieutenant Anita Fiore</a>, an even tanner, more well-built woman, take turns studying a large map on the wall. Nine red and eleven orange flag pins mark various coastal and inland locations of Quartz County. The sound of approaching footsteps causes them to exchange a look of annoyance. Seconds later, the sheriff sticks his head in the door.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Sheriff</span> The press conference starts in a few minutes - are we all clear on what we're going to say?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><img border="0" height="235" width="235" src="../assets/images/craig_headshot.gif" align="right">Craig</span> This is now officially a homicide case - we'll be working with detectives - give the victims' names, ages, and residences - as for who killed them and why, further investigation is required... blah, blah, blah</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Sheriff</span> Don't forget to only take questions from media that can be controlled</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Of course</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">The sheriff adjusts his crotch, abruptly turns around and closes the door as he leaves. Anita flips a pen after him.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Useless prick</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Half-smile) The man himself or what he was adjusting?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> BOTH - it's obvious this guy is impotent on ALL levels - he's not doing his job</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> He tries</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> BULLSHIT - we now have twenty killings in the last two years - if the public ever finds out about the other highly-unusual, unsolved murders we've covered up, our careers are freaking toast!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Calm yourself, Fiore</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Now pacing) I just think it's time to find a new sheriff, that's all</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Stretching his arms above his head and yawning) All in good time, Lieutenant, all in good time</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Some of the local fishermen are whispering about &quot;Aleta Oscura&quot; again</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Sighing) That's all we need - find a way to keep them quiet</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Raising an eyebrow) I think they might be on to something</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Oh please, don't tell me you believe in that crap?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Listen, Craig, who or WHAT ever this thing is, it's way beyond some punk with a pistol playing vigilante or knocking off the hired help - we need to consider ALL possibilities here</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">The captain scratches the corner of his moustache and ponders in silence.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Those men this morning didn't just &quot;wash up&quot; on the beach... THEY WERE DELIVERED ON OUR GOD DAMN DOORSTEP... the coordinates and the slip number of the fishing boat were scrawled in the sand next to the bodies - it KNEW it would only take us a few minutes to figure out who these guys were</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Then why won't this thing point us in the direction of who is hiring these men to perform illegal activities?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I guess she figures SOMEONE needs to do their job</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> SHE?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> In Espa&ntilde;ol, &quot;Aleta Oscura&quot; is the feminine form of... &quot;Dark Fin&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK, ANITA</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Looking at her watch) Maybe next time - we need to get ready</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">The two of them stand side by side and primp in front of a large mirror in the corner.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Fixing his cap) How irresistible do we look in these uniforms?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Checking her short, black hair) Between that and being on TV, we'll never run out of easy snatch</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">The lieutenant's cell phone rings.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Hola - great, I'll meet you outside</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><img border="0" height="323" width="420" src="../assets/images/courthouse.jpg" alt="Duquesa Bay Court House" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">Craig</span> That was quick!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> It was my SISTER, she's picking me up to have dinner with our folks after the press conference</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Trying not to show his excitement) Is she here?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Yeah... and so is her husband!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Oh</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Sandy is going to be giving a statement on behalf of the university when we're finished</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That's good, we need some scientific authority to calm the public... confirm that &quot;Jaws&quot; or some giant squid didn't kill these men and that Duquesa Bay is, once again, safe for happy families</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Can he talk about the toxic waste on the boat?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Only to say that we did an excellent job of cleaning up the little bit that was dumped - HE IS NOT TO MENTION THE NAMES OF THE BUSINESSES WE FOUND ON THE BAGS AND BARRELS</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Taking the prepared statement off the desk) Understood - do you think Isaacson is going to be a problem?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Walking out of the office) Are you kidding? - Zach already nailed us this morning - he knows he needs information we can't give him... especially at a staged media event</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> (Following) He's going underground</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> That he will... and he'll also be keeping his distance from us tonight, so no worries there</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> I've noticed KCON's new girl, Morrigan</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> I'm sure you have</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Anita</span> Do you think she'll be a problem?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> Nah, because she's new in this town, she knows she has to get herself acclimated first before she starts rattling cages - McBride will keep quiet... this time</p>
 
 
<div class="stage">The two join the sheriff at the podium outside of the building as Morrigan, Gracie, Zach and the rest of the media gather in front of them.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Craig</span> (Clearing his throat) Can you all hear me? - please be quiet so we can get this thing started - are we ready? - OK... good evening, I am Captain Craig Phelps of the... </p>
 
 
<div class="stage">All of the sudden, everyone's pagers and cell phones start to go off as the sound of many sirens fill the air. The following message appears on digital screens:</div>
