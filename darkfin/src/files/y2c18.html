  <h1>Year 2, Chapter 18</h1><h2>&quot;Holy Water, Sacred Ground&quot;</h2>


<div class="stage">Finishing a telephone conversation, KJ von Meer bangs his fist down on the kitchen table in his family's mansion and heads into the main parlor where his sister, Erika, is tinkering around with a Dvorak tune on the piano. He flops onto the leather sofa and sighs.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Still playing) What's the problem, dear brother, and you better not say my music</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No, I'm just at a loss as to what to do next</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Do about what?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Morrigan</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika ceases playing and softly steps over to his side.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking a seat next to him) What about Ms. McBride?</p>
 
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Things aren't looking real good - I was just on the phone 
 with Sutter and he says that the case against her is firming up</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> She hasn't even been officially charged yet</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> It's only a matter of time - they want to make it as airtight as possible before going through the formalities</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Well, Sutter isn't the only criminal defense attorney out there - maybe you should talk to...</p>
 
<div class="stage">KJ jumps up in anger and faces his sister.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> LOOK, RIKKA, I DON'T TELL YOU HOW TO DISSECT FISH - I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE LAW THAN YOU DO</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c18_kj.jpg" width="420" height="420" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Taking his hand) Kage, relax - I'm sorry - I wasn't trying to be disrespectful, I was just trying to offer a suggestion</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Now pacing) Don't you think that I have been racking my brain, trying to come up with other solutions? - Sutter is the best criminal defense attorney in all of California and he's doing this as a personal favor to me</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I know - but we have resources, we can get whom or whatever we need to help Morrigan</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> You try convincing her of that - she insists on paying me back for the legal fees and for the security around her house</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Scowling) Silly pride</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Would you act any different if you were in her shoes?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I suppose not... I wish I could do more</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Right now, you're the best thing going for her - it was damn lucky you literally ran into her that night</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> It's only a partial alibi</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> A partial alibi is better than no alibi at all</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Maybe I could change my story to make it more beneficial to her</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT - do you even know what you're suggesting?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I want to protect her interests</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> WHY? - you barely know her - you wouldn't even lie for mom's DUI and here you want to protect a possible murderer?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Curt) You think she did it?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> No... but I am more than a little curious as to why you would be willing to risk perjury for her?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Standing up and looking away from him) She's not like the others you've dated, is she?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Now on the defensive) Um... no, not al all</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Turning to face him) You care for Morrigan very deeply, don't you?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Half smile) Yeah... is it that obvious?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Returning the smile) Kinda... I don't want to see that ruined because of a timing technicality</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Sis, I really appreciate what you're trying to do for me but it's not going to happen - your story needs to stay rock solid, if the prosecution has the slightest hint that you're willing to waffle for Morrigan, you're dead in the water and so is her defense</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika regretfully nods in agreement.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Besides, I will not have my sister sink any deeper into this mess - two of the most important women to me are already in enough trouble</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Two?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Morri and Oni</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Stunned) Ona Rosa Sanchez? - what does she have to do with this?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Wringing his hands) Sutter told me of another card to play but it's out of the question</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> What are you talking about?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> After Morrigan, the next highest-ranking suspect is Ona Rosa's father</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Frank Fiore can hardly move around!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> But he can fire a gun with no problem and his prints are all over the murder weapon</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> That's purely circumstantial</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> I've seen cases stick on less - Sutter wants to actively shift the focus onto him</p>
 
<div class="stage">Before Erika can respond, the alarm on KJ's watch sounds.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> Listen, mom and dad are at the club, I promised to have dinner with them - wanna come with?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> No, not really</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> C'mon, you need to get out - I'm tired of arguing with you about this</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> Another time, I promise - I'm not up to dealing with mother in a public setting tonight</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> You need a good meal</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> I have something waiting for me in the fridge - besides, I was hoping to have some time to myself to rest</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">KJ</span> (Throwing up his hands) Fine, the house is all yours then, have fun!</p>
 
<div class="stage">Snatching his sport coat, KJ strides out the door and zooms off in his Porsche. After making sure she is truly alone, Erika heads for the kitchen and opens the freezer. She reaches behind a box of Dove dark chocolate ice-cream bars and retrieves a syringe filled with a clear solution.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Popping the cap off of the needle) Time for a special treat!</p>
 
<div class="stage">She promptly sticks the syringe into her arm and injects all of the serum into a vein. She recaps the top and tosses the syringe into the garbage compactor.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Yawning and talking to herself) I'll let this settle into my system for a few hours and then drive up to Quartz Lake to complete the freshwater submersion testing</p>
 
<div class="stage">The von Meer daughter goes back into the freezer for one of the ice-cream bars.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Preparing to open one) Once this has been accomplished, it will be one less hurdle to deal with and I can...</p>
 
<div class="stage">Erika suddenly becomes rigid and saliva begins to pour out of her mouth. Her whole body starts to tremble as she grabs a hold of the counter top to keep from falling over.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> NO - it... wasn't supposed... to happen... this quick - AAARRRGGHH</p>
 
<div class="stage">She smashes a stack of porcelain dishware to her left and charges out the back door. Sprinting across the property, a snarling Erika rips off all of her clothes as if she were on fire.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Erika</span> (Diving into the duck pond) I have to change, NOW</p>
 
<div class="stage">Within seconds, the transformation into Darkfin successfully takes place. Although she has physically stabilized, her instincts and emotions are hyper sensitive.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Leaping out of the pound) I NEED... TO FEED</p>
 
<div class="stage">She goes through half a dozen ducks in less than a minute. Covered in feathers and blood, Aleta Oscura sets off through the woodland properties of Beacon Point's ultra elite, attempting to make her way to the sea.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> I NEED TO KILL</p>
 
<div class="stage">In the vast backyard of the Martel Estate, Ben and his three children are enjoying a barbecue by themselves.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> OK kids, who wants to try daddy's famous Blue Cheese Canadian Bacon Burger?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Palmer</span> (Jumping over with is mouth open) I WANT ONE, I WANT ONE</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> (Practicing her dance moves next to the pool) EWW - when is mom going to get here?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> You know she's working late at the station</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> (Twirling) When isn't she working late at the station?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> Granddad will be here soon</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> Big thrill</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> Kay... watch that attitude</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> Where's Auntie Ursula?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> She's... um, gone on a little trip to a spa up north, she'll be back soon</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Palmer</span> (Making a fierce face) GIMME BURGER, RRRRRR, FOOD</p>
 
<div class="stage">Palmer grabs it and stuffs nearly a half into his mouth.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> Don't forget to masticate, son</p>
 
<div class="stage">He sticks his tongue out with chewed food on it and grunts.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> Palmer, you are SO disgusting!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> (Looking around) Where's your sister?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Kayla</span> (Rolling her eyes) Off searching for bugs - I'm going inside to wait for mom</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> (Shouting) HANNAH, DINNER</p>
 
<div class="stage">In a bush on the far end of the property, little Hannah is examining a clump of earthworms she dug up. She shows them to her teddy bear.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hannah</span> (Laughing and poking at them) WIGGLY</p>
 
<div class="stage">She is suddenly scooped up by Darkfin and is brought within inches of her face. The young girl gasps but does not scream. The two stare at each other in silence for a moment. A large smile crosses the girl's face and she carefully reaches out her hand and pats the top of Darkfin's head.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c18_df_kid.jpg" width="620" height="621" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Hannah</span> POINTY</p>
 
<div class="stage">Attempting to control her ragged breathing, Aleta Oscura slowly sets the child down. Hannah picks up one of the worms and kindly offers it to Darkfin.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Ben</span> HANNAH, COME GET YOUR DINNER... DON'T MAKE ME COME LOOK FOR YOU</p>
 
<div class="stage">Like a shot, Darkfin takes off again. Palmer ambles through the bushes towards his sister.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Palmer</span> Dad is getting mad - come eat now!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hannah</span> I wanna stay here</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Palmer</span> If you don't eat your burger, I will</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Hannah</span> Maybe green monster lady want some</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Palmer</span> The only monster around here is MEEE - RRRRRRGGHH</p>
 
<div class="stage">Hannah squeals as her brother chases her back towards the house. Now at a deserted part of the shoreline, Darkfin swims into the bay and seeks out new pray. She is instantly rewarded with a challenge.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Tracking her target) This should help</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c18_shark.jpg" width="520" height="466" border="0"></p>


<div class="stage">After finishing her successful attack on the shark, a sated and depleted Darkfin swims backs to her lair beneath the island of Concha Dos.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Darkfin</span> (Staggering to her lab table) This... did not go... as well... as expected</p>
 
<div class="stage">She collapses to the ground and curls up in the fetal position.</div>



<bar></bar>


<div class="stage">Arriving at the Chumash burial grounds inside the Kiyomi State Park, Morrigan gets out of her car and is followed by Joenne Mirabello.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Studying her surroundings) Why have you directed me here, Joenne?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I thought it would be appropriate since this is the battleground - is it not, Morri? - or do I call you the &quot;Marked One&quot; or was it the &quot;Annointed One?&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm not sure what you're talking about</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> PLEASE, no more games - I think you have enough plates to spin already - don't add one more</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Why don't you tell me what you think you know?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Climbing some rocks) Nu-uh, Babe, you go first</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Reluctantly joining her) These hooded freaks, what you call &quot;The Clergy,&quot; are after me for some reason - I believe they have framed me for the murder of Father Greg to stop an investigation I was beginning - an investigation into these grounds - grounds that are very valuable and not just for Native American history</p>
 
<div class="stage">The two sit in silence for a moment.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Hmm, I don't think you've told me everything</p>
 
<div class="stage">Morrigan remains tight-lipped.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> BUT... since you've told me SOMETHING, I guess I can take a turn... you're right, these grounds hold something that is very important - The Clergy wants it and so does the United States government - what exactly &quot;IT&quot; is, no one is saying for sure... at least not to me - do you know?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Nonchalantly) I believe it might be oil</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> BZZZZ, WRONG - don't try to screw with me - anyway, digging for the aforementioned &quot;IT&quot; substance is imminent and that has Uncle Sam shitting his shorts - you see, forget about The Clergy, if it falls into the hands of a private corporation...</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> They beat Washington to the oversized moneybags of global profit</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Applauding) Very good!</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> How long have you been... &quot;researching&quot; this project?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I have been on this assignment for over a year now</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Has anyone else worked on it?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Taking a deep breath) Uh, the one before me... was killed by The Clergy or at least we assume it was them</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I'm sorry but not surprised - tell me more about them - are they human?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE - I've have given you more than enough info, it's your turn to spill some truth</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I don't know what else I can tell you</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Why are you so important to them?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I wish I knew</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Smacking Morrigan on the arm) YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW DAMN WELL</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I have an idea but it's not proven</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I'm listening</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Facing Joenne) Tell your superiors that if they keep me out of prison, I will tell them EVERYTHING they want to know - got it?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Even about the &quot;aberration by your side?&quot;</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Cheeks flushing) What are you talking about?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> The Clergy think someone... or something... is helping you - I think they're right</p>
 
<div class="stage">Morrigan turns on her heels and begins to walk away. She is stopped by the sight of a rock painting and stares at the symbols.</div>


<p><img src="../assets/images/y2c18_joenne_morri.jpg" width="420" height="447" border="0"></p>

<p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Studying McBride's reaction) Look familiar?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Taking a step back) Um, no - I just wasn't expecting to see this</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> You really need to bone up... ha ha, pun intended... on your burial ground knowledge</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> I was hoping to talk with Carmen Fiore</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> That's not likely to happen now, is it? - try the public library, Miss Journalist</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Do you know what these symbols mean?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> A few - you see, the Chumash believed that the universe is made up of Three Worlds - the surface of the Earth is compared to an island surrounded by an ocean - this makes up the Middle World - above this lies the Upper World where powerful supernatural beings like Sun, Moon, Morning Star, and other &quot;First People&quot; live</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Sounds similar to most religious mythologies</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> It gets better... below The Middle World lies the Lower World, inhabited by dangerous creatures called &quot;Nunashish&quot; - these beasties come up to the Middle World at night to do their terrorizing</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Softly) Fascinating</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I'm still trying to figure out the robes and chanting part - most likely a tradition from the Spanish settlers</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Tell me more</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> I don't know about you but I've had my fill of Nunashish to last a lifetime</p>
 
<div class="stage">A crow suddenly flying out of the trees startles them both.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> Maybe we should go</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> Yep, the sun is setting, I don't want to be here in another ten minutes</p>
 
<div class="stage">The two hurry back to the car and drive away. Morrigan drops off Joenne at the dance studio.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Morrigan</span> (Out the window) Talk to your superiors and let me know if we have a deal or not</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor">Joenne</span> (Winking) We'll be in touch, one way or the other!</p>
 
<div class="stage">Morrigan speeds off and takes Joenne's suggestion. She stops at the library and checks out several source books on the Chumash. As she is leaving, an older woman shouts at her.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor">Older Woman</span> MAY YOU ROT IN HELL, PRIEST KILLER</p>
 
<div class="stage">Now in tears, Morrigan arrives home and quickly locks the door behind her. She tries to study the books but her mind is racing. She logs on to her computer and sends an instant message to Darkfin.</div>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span>  r u there????</p>
 
<div class="stage">There is no response. Morrigan sighs and goes to make herself some soup. She returns awhile later and finds a message.</div>
<p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> I am -- what do you want?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> i need to see u 2nite</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> Impossible</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> why?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> I am too sick</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> what happened?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> It is not your concern</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> it IS my concern -- are u in your cave?</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> I will be fine tomorrow</p>

 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> NO</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> WHY?????</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#006400">Anon1</color></span> You are not safe here</p>
 <p class="line"><span class="actor"><color="#4b0082">MMcB</color></span> i'm not safe anywhere</p>
