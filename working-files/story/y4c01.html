<stage>Currently on the island of Maui...</stage>


<stage>&quot;DJ Fingerling&quot; (aka Gracie Takanachi) spins her last set inside FLOE, the posh nightclub of a 5-star resort. Very tired and very pregnant, she waddles across the dance floor as a few drunken flailers and unlucky stragglers are ushered out by the management. The bright flashing colors slowly go out, one by one. Red. Pink. Blue. A faint yellow behind the bar is all that remains.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Goodnight... or should I say good morning, folks &mdash; I'll be taking pictures of some of you later for your company's luau, so be sure to lose your shitface &mdash; cucumber slices and Visine are available through the concierge - Aloha auinapo!</line>

<stage>Nu, the buff Polynesian bartender, chuckles as he wipes glasses and takes inventory of the fruit slices. Gracie slides up to the bar and wraps her large white sweater around her.</stage>

<line><actor>Nu</actor> Cold?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Popping a pineapple slice in her mouth) Always</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Your mash-up of Linkin Park and Don Ho was all kinds of wrong</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Moving on to a couple of cherries) Good</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> But you made it work</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I always make it work &mdash; just wait until you hear what I do to Hillary Duff tomorrow night</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Thankfully, I'm off tomorrow night</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Playing with the chopped mint leaves) As an artist, I can take a steaming pile and turn it into a blossoming bouquet</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> (Swatting her hands) Forget artist, you're a miracle worker</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Musically, maybe &mdash; if I were a true miracle worker, I'd be back in Duquesa Bay</line>

<stage>Gracie falls silent as Nu stares at her pensively.</stage>

<line><actor>Nu</actor> It's been a year... maybe it's time for a visit?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> When that thought enters my mind, projectile vomiting usually kicks it back out</line>

<stage>The low rumbles of an approaching storm echo in the distance. The lightning flashes clash with a stray strobe light.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Grabbing a bottle of rum) Mind if I borrow this?</line>

<stage>Nu looks at her in abject horror as she spins it around and places it back behind the bar.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Kidding</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Not funny</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'll make it up to you with a track in your honor &mdash; the &lsquo;Nu's Nu Shooz' mix</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Make it up to me by coming along to Kelly's party this weekend</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Is karaoke involved?</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Only if you want it to be</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Nah, maybe another time</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> That's all you ever say, when are you going to give up the hermit routine?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I like my shell, it has pretty spots</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Believe it or not &mdash; even with your penchant for playing songs from both Simpson sisters &mdash; people like you here and want to be around you</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Yeah well, I don't really want to be around them &mdash; nothing personal but I'm just not looking for socialization right now</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Doesn't it get lonely?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Dude, you've been behind the bar too long &mdash; save it for your psych classes</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Just trying to help</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I know</line>

<stage>Nu throws some bananas, strawberries, pineapple, and vanilla ice-cream into a blender and whips it up.</stage>

<line><actor>Nu</actor> (Pouring it into a large container) Here's your &quot;to go&quot; cup</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Mahalo &mdash; I appreciate you always looking after me</line>
<line><actor>Nu</actor> Do you need me to walk you home?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> It's not that far of a trudge, thanks</line>

<stage>Nu comes out from around the bar and wraps Gracie in a huge hug. She reluctantly reciprocates.</stage>

<line><actor>Nu</actor> (Gently patting her stomach) You take care... both of you</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I promise... see you on your next shift</line>

<stage>As Gracie heads out the door, two beer glasses mysteriously fall from their place and shatter against the bar top.</stage>

<line><actor>Nu</actor> Why does that keep happening?</line>

<stage>With cup in hand, Gracie now shuffles through the ornate hotel lobby and sheepishly waves to the night crew behind the desk.</stage>

<line><actor>Crew #1</actor> Hey Gracie, we get off in ten minutes &mdash; want to have coffee with us?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Thanks but I'm a little tired &mdash; maybe next time</line>
<line><actor>Crew #2</actor> We'll keep trying!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Under her breath) Just leave me the hell alone, people</line>

<stage>Now outside in the eerily quite courtyard, she passes by a well-lit bronze water fountain. The postmodern non-fishlike fish statue gapes at her.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Stop following me with your eyes</line>

<stage>Now quickening her pace from a plod to a shamble, she takes a path that parallels the churning beach. She has been on the island long enough to know that she has less than 20 minutes before the skies pour down.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Almost paradise...</line>

<stage>The sharp ocean breeze whips her long hair across her face. Still on the resort property, she goes beyond the accent-lit tropical bushes behind the guest buildings and heads for the tiny staff bungalows in the far corner.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Fumbling for her keys) Oh great, where did I put them now?</line>

<stage>After searching and swearing for a few moments, she succeeds in finding them. A night bird darts overhead and spooks Gracie with its piercing squawk. It slams into the side of her roof and then flutters off into the night.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Lovely</line>

<stage>Gracie now opens her door and flips on the lights.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Bed, bed, bed &mdash; pee, brush my teeth, and then bed... what the?</line>

<stage>The stark silhouette of a female relaxes out on the patio amongst the gray-blue shadows. She has her back to Gracie, overlooking the ocean.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Ah, not another lost drunk!</line>

<stage>Gracie ambles over to her glass patio door and throws it open with a push.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> HEY LADY, THE GUEST SUITES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE &mdash; YOU'RE IN THE WRONG...</line>

<stage>Morrigan McBride turns around and offers a simple smile.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Gasping in disbelief) Mor...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Hello, Gracie</line>

<stage>Gracie snaps back away from her, squeezes her eyes shut, clenches her fists, and shakes her head.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> GOD DAMN IT, NU PUT SOMETHING FUNNY IN MY DRINK</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Standing up) You're not seeing things... and neither am I</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Now realizing the reality) Morri?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It's really me</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> YOU'RE DEAD</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Not quite, at least not now</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> YOU'RE DEAD, ZACH SAID SO</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> He needs to check his facts</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> MORRI</line>

<stage>The two awkwardly embrace each other. Gracie now takes Morrigan's right arm and twists it hard.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> OW</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Well, you're arm seems fine, YOU COULDN'T CALL ME? WRITE ME? FREAKING IM ME, YOU HEARTLESS BITCH?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Stepping back) I guess I deserved that</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Screaming and crying) YOU DESERVE A HELL OF A LOT MORE FOR MAKING ME THINK I LOST THE ONLY REAL REAL FRIEND I EVER HAD</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I know apologizing is not going to help but it's the only thing I can offer &mdash; I did what I had to do</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Wiping her nose on her sleeve) I'm sure you did</line>

<stage>Gracie stares long and hard at Morrigan's face.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You look... different</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Literally - mind if we go inside?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Freezing in her tracks) HOODIES?</line>

<stage>Gracie frantically scans around the patio.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> No, no Hoods &mdash; not here</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Sigh of relief) Good</line>

<stage>She leads Morrigan inside her place. There is a long silence between the two.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I... I apologize for my reaction &mdash; hormones</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Soft grin) So, I've noticed... congratulations</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y4c01_gracie.jpg" alt="" h="491" w="601"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Yeah</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Is the father a local?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> More like loco &mdash; and no, you're not the only visitor I've had from Duquesa Bay this past year</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> You can't escape your past Grace, no matter how hard you try</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I guess I'm not trying hard enough</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> The father - is it someone I know?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> That depends on who it is...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I see... sorta</line>

<stage>Gracie freezes again.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Wait a minute... are the cops still after you? &mdash; I love you, McBride, but I have a new life here - the only law and order drama I want to deal with is on my TV</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Don't worry, the only &lsquo;police' around here are in your CD case - I'm no longer a fugitive</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Shocked) Seriously?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I was technically &quot;underground&quot; for awhile but I've been free and clear for the last few months</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> How did that happen?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> We have a lot to catch up on</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'll say</line>

<stage>There is another awkward silence.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Taking in the view) This is an awesome place</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> My college buddy is part of the management here &mdash; he hooked me up with a sweet deal &mdash; I take photos of the guests and their functions during the day, I get to do some DJ-ing at the club at night, rent is pretty cheap &mdash; yeah, I lucked out</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Musing) I'm happy one of us did</line>

<stage>Gracie does not know what to say. She nervously twirls her much-longer hair</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Noticing) I like it - it looks good on you</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Can I get you something to drink?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Some hot water, please</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I have lemon tea, green tea, and chamomile</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> No tea... just the hot water</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Still with the mystery &mdash; does it ever end with you?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'll let you know when it does</line>

<stage>Morrigan continues to admire the furniture as Gracie heats up the water.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> No more ugly futon</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Nope, most of the d&eacute;cor comes courtesy of the resort but I can add a few of my personal touches</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> What, no tiki masks?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I live in the land of tiki, I no longer need them on my walls</line>

<stage>Morrigan inspects several black and white framed photos covering one large wall. Smiling, happy strangers stare back at her.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Besides, as you can see, I've moved on to living masks</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Outstanding work as usual &mdash; hey, is that us?</line>

<stage>They both peer at a photo taken long ago of Zach, Amy, Morrigan, and Gracie playing pinochle.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I secretly shot that on a time delay &mdash; we all had such a look of innocence and fun on our faces &mdash; it's one of my favorites</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Where did the time go?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I dunno &mdash; I still remember yelling at you to cover up that ketchup-stained Smurfette shirt before you went on air</line>

<stage>For the first time, the two relax a bit and reflect fondly over the memory.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> My first day working for KCON &mdash; it seems like yesterday</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> More like a different lifetime ago... your water's ready</line>

<stage>Gracie fiddles in the kitchen with their beverages and some stale graham crackers while Morrigan continues to study the photos.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Is that who I think it is?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Yep, that's Ortega and his new beau &mdash; they came for a vacation a few months ago</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> He looks familiar</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Think late-night infomercials</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> NO &mdash; that's not Marc of &lsquo;Muscles by Marc?'</line>

<stage>Gracie makes a ridiculous face and strikes a body-building pose.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Aw, I'm happy for Austin &mdash; how's his job in Miami?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Lovin' it &mdash; half the pay and a crappy weekend weather slot but anything is better than KCON</line>

<stage>The two fall silent again.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Sitting down at the table) Here's your hot aqua</line>

<stage>Morrigan joins her at the table and drops a small thermometer into the mug.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm not even going to ask</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I love that wedding photo in the corner &mdash; who's the happy couple?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> They were guests of the hotel, I covered their reception</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Snacking on a cracker) I hope you got paid double because that's worthy of a bridal magazine cover</line>

<stage>Gracie opens a jar of pepperoncinis and wolfs them down.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Offering them to Morrigan) Want some?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Not in the mood, thanks</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Most of the people in the photos are work-related... weddings, anniversaries, corporate retreats, birthday parties - I fell in love with their expressions</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Have you tried showing these at all?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> That would mean being social &mdash; doing the whole phony artsy-fartsy gallery thing &mdash; I'm just not up to that right now</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Maybe in a few months?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Maybe a few years...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> You really ought to think seriously about...</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I said NOT NOW</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Sorry</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> No, I'm sorry &mdash; I've been a little short with people lately</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Especially with people who should mind their own business</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You never could &mdash; that's why you made such a damn good reporter</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Wistfully) Yep</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> And that's why Shepperton hated your guts &mdash; she knew her beauty queen looks couldn't hold a candle to your solid skills</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Kylee is smarter than she realizes &mdash; she opts for the easy road with her body instead of the rough road with her brain</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Do you think she'll ever get tired of being a guy's &quot;filler fuck?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> That depends on what you mean</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You know, the girl he uses between real relationships or between wives - I know I finally did</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I suppose it depends on whether she's unhappy being that filler or not &mdash; some women don't seem to mind that at all</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You're right &mdash; my brother is dating this gal, a total positivity princess whose sole purpose seems to be cheering him up, cheering him on, and catering to his sexual needs</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Where can we buy one of those?</line>

<stage>The two chuckle as rain begins to bombard the ceiling.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Uh, shall we continue the small talk and pretend we ran into each other at The Coffee Bean or try for something deeper?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm enjoying the small talk for now</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Biting her lips) Works for me</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> As far as Kylee Shepperton goes, at least one of the &quot;old gang&quot; is still on the air</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Like where else would she be? - after Claudia's death, she crawled right out of Turner's bed and into the lead anchor chair</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Do you ever think about going back?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> To KCON? &mdash; no &mdash; to Duquesa Bay? - HELL NO</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm talking about TV in general</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> No, that door is pretty much closed to me now</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Ditto</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> What are you doing now or dare I ask?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Actually... I'm working for the PCOC</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> How... how could you do that?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I have my reasons</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Sell out!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> That's one way of looking at it</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Aren't you afraid someone will come after you?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Always... but I have an ace or two up my sleeve</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Well, I suppose getting a boatload of cash working in the corporate sector is fair trade for your soul</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm not doing it for the money</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> No, it's something more complex as usual &mdash; and I need to be drunk to handle your truth, Morri, and since that can't happen, I'm asking for small doses... at least for now</line>

<stage>They both go to say something, change their minds, and retreat behind more crackers.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Biting one in half) You know, I really miss Henshaw's strawberry-apricot preserves</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I heard he was doing better at the clinic</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You mean the nut house, the funny farm, the rubber room...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It's better than a jail cell</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I don't blame him for what he did &mdash; KCON and Dan were synonymous</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Gracie &mdash; the man took a loaded handgun into the newsroom and nearly killed himself and Turner</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> AFTER he was forced out of his contract &mdash; Steel departed prematurely for that great news desk in the sky, what a grand oportunidad for Gates to clean house and elevate his little Kylee queen bee to the throne!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Stop being snide, Gracie, for once</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Start being straight with me, Morri, for once</line>

<stage>Morrigan checks the mini thermometer and plops a fizzing yellow tablet into the mug.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Excuse me for a second</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Okaaaaay...</line>

<stage>Morrigan rushes out the patio door and returns a few seconds later. She calmly steps inside and takes her seat at the table.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> So...</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> So...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> When are you going to ask about what happened to me?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm getting around to it &mdash; why don't you ask me more about me &mdash; that's always an interesting subject</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Fine, I'll ask... when are you due?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Less than three months</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Is this something you wanted or was it an accident?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> The first few months, I was in complete denial &mdash; I was so busy establishing my new life here, I wasn't really thinking about it &mdash; finally, when I saw the bump in the mirror one morning, I knew I had to make a choice</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Understandable</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm still a little defensive and I'm not absolutely sure what I'm going to do</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It seems a little too late to change your mind</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm talking about after &mdash; I might give it up for adoption &mdash; it depends...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Well... whatever you decide to do, I will support your decision 110%</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I mean, we're smart women &mdash; how did we get here, to this point in our lives?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm trying to think of something profound or pithy to say but all I can truly do is shrug my shoulders</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'd always preach that we're one simple catastrophe away from the barefoot and pregnant days &mdash; and now here I am, walking on the beach, barefoot and pregnant</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> When you're surrounded by soft sand and endless daiquiris, I could see how that might be a byproduct</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> It didn't happen that way &mdash; I wish it did</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Nothing is ever simple with us, is it?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> At least my dad didn't have to sell me off to some hairy guy for two dozen sheep and wheelbarrow</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Smirking) No wheelbarrow necessary &mdash; two dozen sheep is more than a fair price</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (On the verge of tears) God, I missed you - I miss you, so much!</line>

<stage>The two hug again for a moment. Gracie breaks off and, with affection and concern, cups the side of Morrigan's face in her hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> So...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> So...</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm guessing you're not going to a costume party?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Correct</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Living out a pirate fetish?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Not this year</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Does it hurt?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It did at the time</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Is there anything I can do?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Not now</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Is there anything anyone can do?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Nope</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Shit</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Yep</line>

<stage>Morrigan gets up from the table and looks at herself in a wall mirror. She adjusts the black eye patch over her left eye.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y4c01_morri-big.jpg" alt="" h="505" w="564"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Sorry &mdash; I wish I could say something more but what do you say?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It's what you don't say</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Can I look underneath? &mdash; do you have a glass eye with diamonds in it?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Examples of what you don't say</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Curiosity gets the better of me at times &mdash; did that happen in the hospital explosion?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It would have been easier if it did</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> It's hard to imagine Bay Valley Medical Center as the site of so much death and carnage...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Not a big stretch when you honestly think about it</line>

<stage>Gracie bursts out laughing and Morrigan can't help but follow.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I know, we should get a card game going and say that we don't play with chips, we play with body parts &mdash; totally freak everyone out!</line>

<stage>Gracie now starts to sob.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Games, Morri, games &mdash; I'm so sick of freaking games!</line>

<stage>Gracie struggles to her feet and shoves her chair in anger.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> They're fine at a fuzzy green table or with little silver pieces you can throw across the room &mdash; not with paychecks, not with someone's heart... or with someone's life</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I know</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Then WHY do I get the overwhelming feeling that you brought another game with you?</line>

<stage>Morrigan only answers with a guilty expression.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'll leave first thing in the morning</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Wiping her nose) Just... just tell me what's going on and you can stay here as long as you need</line>

<stage>Gracie suddenly freezes and gawks at her glass patio door. Darkfin, mug in hand, peers back at them.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> My ace of spades needs to stay in your tub</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y4c01_df-mug.jpg" alt="" h="614" w="314"  b="0"></p>
