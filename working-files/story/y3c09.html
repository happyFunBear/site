<h2>Insanity Intensified</h2>

<stage>At the USCG base, Captain Craig Phelps gawks in disbelief 
 at the erupting Mt. Wiggins in the distance. Lieutenant Anita Fiore 
 speeds up the road and stops just short of him.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> (Jumping out of her car) Do you believe this, do you 
 fucking believe this?</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Kilauea put on these kinds of shows when I was stationed 
 in Hawaii - that was expected - this... this is totally unexpected</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> No, I'm talking about the Coast Guard forcing us back 
 on the active roster after treating us like perros.</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Simply focus on the hazardous duty pay</line>

<stage>Anita kicks at the ground as they hurry over to a helicopter 
 and climb inside.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> (Preparing for take off) We get slammed in front of 
 the admiral for something we had no control over...</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Anita</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> They dock our pay, plant our asses at a desk off base...</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Don't rehash this</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> But now, NOW they order us to return when all hell breaks 
 loose, literally</line>

<stage>Craig sighs and rubs his face.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> (Mimicking voice) It's your duty in a time of crisis</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Please</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> We need you!</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> LIEUTENANT FIORE, THAT IS ENOUGH</line>

<stage>Anita looks at Craig with a silent response.</stage>

<line><actor> Craig</actor> We have a job to do</line>

<stage>They lift off into the air. There is uncomfortable tension 
 between them as they fly over the Santa Conchita Valley. Anita mutters 
 something to herself in Spanish.</stage>

<line><actor> Craig</actor> Hey, I know exactly how you feel - who is riding shotgun 
 with you throughout this mess?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> I just can't believe they let us back into another bird 
 after WE supposedly were the responsible party for toasting the last 
 one</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> People's lives are at risk right now... the whole valley 
 is at risk right now</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> So, what in the hell are we doing up here?</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Following orders</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> YAY</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> TO DO WHAT WE CAN - we need to coordinate with officials 
 on how best to assess the situation and assist wherever we are needed 
 - understood?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Claro!</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Besides... this is probably the best place to be right 
 now</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> I told my folks to grab what they needed and hightail 
 it up the coast... but the really weird thing is that papi was already 
 in tears before all this went down</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Why?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> I have no clue - ma came home with him from her monthly 
 heritage meeting and both of them were deeply upset over something</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Probably bake sale issues - is Ona Rosa safe?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Yeah, yeah, she and the kids were at the church - DAMMIT, 
 the frequencies are all screwed tonight, I can barely get a channel 
 open!</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Head southwest towards sector twelve</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Copy that</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> (Still staring at the active volcano) Amazing, absolutely 
 amazing - OW</line>

<stage>Craig grabs his head in pain.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> You okay?</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> I'm still dealing with a nasty headache, not to mention 
 a case of nerves... our last ride up wasn't exactly a barrel of laughs</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> My wrist is still throbbing, of course it didn't help 
 throwing a punch</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Let me guess... was Marcy somehow involved?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Somehow</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Hmm</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Shall we talk about Ursula now or the impending destruction 
 of Duquesa Bay?</line>

<stage>Craig flashes her a sideways glance.</stage>

<line><actor> Craig</actor> You are an excellent actress, Fiore - if we do get discharged, 
 you really ought to ask your girlfriend for a part... that is, if we're 
 not all covered in ash</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> What are you blabbering about now, Tonto?</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Can you honestly look me in the eye and say that you 
 are not scared shitless? - this isn't freaking you out at all?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> I am DONE being freaked out, man - dealing with a superhuman 
 fish chick pretty much put me over the top</line>

<stage>Craig manages to chuckle.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> I'm just waiting for the splatter of frogs and locusts 
 on the windshield</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Not now, PLEASE not now</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> I wonder what her connection is to all of this?</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Who?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Aleta Oscura</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Right, she is responsible for a naturally occurring 
 tectonic event?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> There aint nothing natural about ANY of this mierda 
 but I do know she's dead center!</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> Let's refocus and try to keep Chaparral Heights from 
 being the next Pompeii</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Spare me the Jeopardy question and check out the military 
 squawk that's coming over this chan... AYYY</line>

<stage>Two U.S. fighter jets zoom past them on a rapid ascent. 
 Anita fights against the wake and quickly regains control.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c09_chopper_jets.jpg" h="403" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Holding his mouth) Not again</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING HERE?</line>

<stage>The lieutenant spins the helicopter around and scans 
 out the port side.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> And why is there a special ops Apache hovering at 10 
 o'clock?</line>
<line><actor> Craig</actor> They're most likely responding to the eruption</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Unless I missed the memo, I don't think firing missiles 
 at a volcano is standard protocol... there's something else going on 
 down there!</line>

<stage>Nearly jumping out of his skin, Karl Senior rears against 
 his bed as Stephanie keeps the needle aimed at Hector.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c09_steph_hector.jpg" h="406" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> What do you mean Joe's dead? - why are you dressed 
 like that?</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> HE'S ONE OF THEM, KILL HIM</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Kill him? - Karl, just relax - Hector, what in God's 
 name is going on?</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> I'll do my best to explain it in the simplest of terms 
 later...</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> (Lowering the needle) SIMPLE TERMS? - you're talking 
 to an MD who graduated summa from Stanford, don't you dare condescend 
 to me!</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> (Glancing out the window) Now is not the time for this</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN, HE HAS POWERS</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Powers? - he can barely pick his underwear up off 
 the floor</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> (Sultry voice) That's because I hardly wore any with 
 you, Stephi, you liked it that way</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> UGH</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Tell me what happened to Joe?</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> There's nothing you can do for him now - COME, we must 
 leave here - the lava flow is headed in this direction</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU OR YOUR KIND</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Karl, where is this racism coming from?</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> It's not racism</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> Look, von Meer, I had PLENTY of opportunities to kill 
 you... but I couldn't - if I had offered you up, my stature would have 
 been elevated even more... but I didn't</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> Why didn't you?</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> I did not agree with what was taking place... they 
 misused the Marked One</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> (In tears) No!</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> And because of that, we're all doomed</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> (Hearing the fire alarm) I have NO idea what is 
 going on here but we need to leave, the hotel is being evacuated</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> Is your patient up to it?</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> He'll have to be - we need to keep him hidden from 
 the guests</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> With Mt. Wiggins, do you really think people will take 
 notice?</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> I can't take the chance... I promised Erika</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> Erika...</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> (Handing over his blue robe) Here, he can put this 
 on</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> I'D RATHER DIE BEFORE I'D WEAR THAT RAG</line>
<line><actor> Hector</actor> You very well could!</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> ENOUGH - Hector, go get my car - Karl, keep calm 
 and put this on</line>
<line><actor> Karl</actor> But...</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> NO ARGUMENTS, LET'S GO</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Amethyst and Zach run across an open field, away from 
 the eruption.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c09_zach_amy.jpg" h="510" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Looking back in horror) WHAT... HOW... WHY?</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> KEEP MOVING, WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> (Grabbing his lower back and stumbling) AHH</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> ZACH</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Regaining his footing) I'm okay, I'm okay... BUT YOU'RE 
 NOT - TELL ME WHO OR WHAT YOU ARE</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> I can't honestly explain this to you right now but I promise 
 I'll tell you everything, baby, I will</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I knew you were into crystals and candles and crap but 
 I didn't know you took it to a cult level - what kind of psychotropic 
 shit did your buddies trip me on? - peyote, datura, what?</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> I'm... I'm not sure</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> THEY HAVE MORRI, WHAT DID THEY DO TO MORRI?</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> (Tears flowing) I'm going back for her</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> GOING BACK TO WHAT? - THE MOUNTAIN IS ON FIRE, AMY</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> Keep moving, Zach</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Who is this Darkfin she called out for? - is that your 
 leader?</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> No</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Then, who is?</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> My father...</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Your dad? - I thought you said your dad was dead?
<line><actor> Amy</actor>  He is</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Stop, stop, STOP WITH THE FREAK SHOW, RIGHT NOW</line>
<line><actor> Amy</actor> Stay on this path, it will lead you to Via Royal in about 
 a quarter of a mile</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Where are you going?</line>

<stage>A gust of wind brushes Zach's face as he turns around. 
 Amethyst is gone.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> Amy? - AMY? - AHH</line>

<stage>Zach grabs his bleeding backside and collapses to the 
 ground crying.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>The KCON news van barrels down Via Royal at high speed 
 away from the eruption.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (White knuckles behind the wheel) This was SUPPOSED 
 to be my night off - I was SUPPOSED to be home enjoying a black olive 
 pizza, watching the latest Olsen Twin movie - I was SUPPOSED to be doing 
 my laundry...</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> You actually do laundry, Grace? - funny, you can never 
 tell with your wardrobe</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> (Holding a cold drink to the back of her head) As 
 a woman of science, I can tell you that tonight's happenings are most 
 profound</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I'm so glad you explained that to me, WOMAN OF SCIENCE, 
 I never would have reached that conclusion on my own!</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> It will lead not only KCON but every news channel 
 in the world and you're whining about an Olsen Twin movie? - get a life!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> NONE of us are going to have a life if that thing keeps 
 spewing like it is</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> This is real bad - this is worse than the tornado that 
 nearly decapitated Jimmy Daddy - this mailbox shaped like a sunbathing 
 pig came flying out of nowhere and...</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> SHUT UP, WHITER SHADE OF TRASH</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> No need to get testy</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I grew up in the shadow of Mount St. Helens - I remember 
 it CLEARLY as a kid and this thing has it beat by a landslide... literally</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> (Wiping a tear) I only hope Joenne is safe</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> By the way, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> I know it's tied to McBride and the abnormality known 
 as Father Greg</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> MORRIGAN, MORRIGAN, MORRIGAN, WHY IS IT ALWAYS ABOUT 
 MORRIGAN?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I can't deal with this</line>

<stage>Gracie slams on the brakes and pulls over to the side.</stage>

<line><actor> Justine</actor> What are you doing?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> If I'm to die in Dante's Inferno with the two people 
 I least want by my side... my last act can be filming the beautiful 
 horror of it</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> You're sick!</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Let me redo my makeup, first</line>

<stage>Gracie hops out of the van and sets up her camera to 
 tape Mt. Wiggins.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Maybe now I'll finally get into National Geographic</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> (Stepping into view) I just wanted to say that Teddy 
 Jackson, you were my first and I'll always love you, GO CRIMSON TIDE</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Turning the camera to Justine) Mirabello, you have 
 any fourth grade memories you want to share?</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> YOU TWO ARE INSANE, I WANT TO LEAVE, I WANT TO LIVE</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> 'Bye!</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> Gimme the damn van keys!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Ooh, WOMAN OF SCIENCE, GENIUS IQ GIRL, you don't know 
 how to start an engine without keys?</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> I'M GONNA KICK YOUR FAT ASS, TAKANACHI</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> YOU'D HAVE TO MOVE YOUR FATTER ASS, FIRST</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> (Turning the camera back on herself) And this is for 
 Kendra McCauley, I was the one who trashed your homecoming float, not 
 Shane, not Heather, ME - I did it!</line>

<stage>Zach stumbles down the road into view.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> LADIES - YOU ALL HAVE NEVER LOOKED SO GORGEOUS</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Running towards him) ZACH</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> (Following) Zachary Isaacson, I'm going to kill you!</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Stand in line</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I can't believe I'm actually happy to see you, Eyes</line>

<stage>Gracie helps him limp down the road.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> Let me get into the van before you all share the love</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Noticing the blood on the back of his pants) What 
 happened to you?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> NOT NOW, GRACE... not now</line>

<stage>The two share a pained look of sadness.</stage>

<line><actor> Justine</actor> We all seriously need to leave before the ash blinds 
 and or chokes us to death!</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> And it's ruining my hair</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I agree - the roads leading out of the city are going 
 to be a nightmare</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Grabbing her camera) I know some shortcuts... let's 
 go</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>A waterlogged Griffin is sobbing by the riverbank outside 
 of his condo complex as KJ pulls up in his car.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Rushing over) GRIF - WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON - YOU MADE 
 NO SENSE ON THE PHONE</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> (Hysterical) I swam up and down this section five 
 times...</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> WHERE'S MY SISTER?</line>

<stage>Griffin continues to sob. KJ slaps him hard across the 
 face.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> WHERE IS ERIKA, MAN?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> She saw the eruption... she dove off my balcony...</line>

<stage>KJ runs around in a circle trying to comprehend everything 
 that is happening.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> I don't understand, I don't understand any of this!</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> I know she's an excellent swimmer but even she couldn't 
 survive that fall</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Sprinting along the riverbank) KEEP LOOKING, JUST KEEP 
 LOOKING</line>

<stage>The two men go a short distance before they run into 
 Shelby Willis and her young son, Calvin. They are reverently tossing 
 rings of flowers and fruit into the water.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> SHEL</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> HAVE YOU SEEN ERIKA?</line>

<stage>Shelby ignores them both and continues to chant.</stage>

<line><actor> Calvin</actor> Mommy talking to Chango...</line>

<stage>KJ and Griffin look at each other puzzled.</stage>

<line><actor> Calvin</actor> (Pointing to the volcano) He's over there 
</line>
