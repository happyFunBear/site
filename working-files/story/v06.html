<stage>The 1996 Miss America Pageant Individual Interview Portion:</stage>

<line><actor>MC</actor> Please welcome our next contestant, Kylee Shepperton from New Hope, Alabama... ladies and gentlemen, KYLEE</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Waving) Good evening, everyone!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) THANK GOD no one found out my real name is Kylee Bochner and that my brother is constantly in and out of prison</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> New Hope, such a great name for a city!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Big smile) Yes, it sure is - I suppose you could say it gave me a lot of HOPE for all of my endeavors</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) &quot;Cesspool Central&quot; would be more appropriate and the only hope it gave me was &quot;Please God, get me the fuck out of here!&quot;</line>

<line><actor>MC</actor> That's wonderful - so, tell us a little about your life there</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Life was wonderful in New Hope, there was always singing and dancing and laughing in our house - a house full of family warmth and love</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) Actually, there was more screaming and crying, a trailer full of despair as well as mental, physical and sexual abuse</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> Fantastic - it says here that you are a senior at the University of Alabama, is that correct?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Raising her fist) GO CRIMSON TIDE</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) I WISH I had gone to Auburn</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> And what is your field of study?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Communications with a minor in dance</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) Also known as the &quot;clips, hips and lips special&quot;</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> Why Communications?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> I believe that communication is the common root we all share as a human race and when we learn to overcome obstacles and achieve greater communication, the result is better understanding and world peace... I want to be a part of that</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) I JUST GODDAMN BLEW IT</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> Ah, it says here that your childhood news idol was Jessica Savitch of NBC?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> That's right, when I was a little girl, my momma used to point to the TV and say &quot;Someday, Honey, I hope you'll be just like her!&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) She'd also say &quot;For the love of God, just don't end up a checker at the Jitney-Jungle!&quot;</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> Tell us a little more about your idol</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> She was a real pioneer for women in broadcast news</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) She was also was a burnt-out coke whore who died in a tragic car crash</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> And why did you admire her?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Besides her career achievements, I also admired Jessica for her tenacity and determination in a male-dominated field</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) And she had pretty eyes</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> (Nervous) Heh, but it's not dominated like that anymore, is it?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Shaking her head) Oh no, not at all!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) Lookie, I just lied to America and they all know it!</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> Tell us about your charity, &quot;Dance Away Sorrow, Dance Away Sadness&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Since dance is my specialty, I helped start DASDAS as a way to share my joy with those who normally would not participate in such activities - it gives me great pleasure and fulfillment when I show deaf kids how to bust a move</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) It was either them or rumba with the smelly old people at the home</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> That is truly fascinating, so your students can actually feel the music?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> They sure can!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) I once turned on the washing machine and told them it was Pearl Jam</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> We're coming down to our last few questions</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Great!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) How much longer is this bullshit gonna take?</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> As Miss America, your duties involve a whirl-wind tour around our great nation for a whole year, meeting fascinating people and doing important work - are you prepared for this?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Absolutely, I can't wait to share the ideals of the Miss America Pageant with everyone and help out where I'm needed!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) A whole year of opening up new shopping centers, visiting sick children and banging overseas servicemen, I CAN'T WAIT</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> One of the highlights of the Miss America Tour is getting to ride the giant turkey in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, looking forward to that?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> It would be an honor</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) It's not the first time I'd have to straddle an old bird and it sure as hell won't be the last</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> (Looking out at the audience) I understand you have your mother and your grandfather, Boopaw, as your cheering section tonight?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Of course!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) DAMN, I paid security to keep the skank and the old coot out!</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> Boopaw?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Heh, when I was a tiny thing, my granddaddy would take his dentures out, put them in his hand and chase me around the yard screaming &quot;BOO&quot; - so, I called him Boopaw</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) Bastard has given me nightmares for life</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> How adorable - and now I have to ask for all of the single men in the audience, is there a boyfriend?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> No, not at this time</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) Don't forget the married men, Buddy - I'm guessing in a few hours I'll have plenty to pick from, maybe even a sheik or two</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> Final question, if you wished for one thing to come true, what would it be and why?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Thinks for a moment) Well, besides the obvious of no more war and famine, I would have to say that I would wish for everyone to spend a few minutes in my heart so they, too, could participate in this glorious, one-of-a-kind experience</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind) And so they could hear the REAL answers kicking around in my head</line>
<line><actor>MC</actor> What a great answer, thank you, Kylee - ladies and gentlemen, Miss Alabama, Kylee Shepperton!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Thank you and God Bless America!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor>(In her mind as she walks off) No matter what happens here tonight, I have a standing offer to join KCON because I agreed to let the station manager screw me in the ass</line>
