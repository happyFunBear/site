<stage>Three miles off shore of Concha Dos, the middle island of the &quot;Las Islas Conchas&quot; trio in Duquesa Bay, Erika von
  Meer enjoys some alone time aboard her sailboat &quot;The White Tara.&quot; Stretching and sunning herself, she opens her
  lab book and begins to write in it, using the ancient Pali code.</stage>

  <p>I believe I have found the reasons as to why it took time to complete the change back from the last transmogrification.
    If the simulations parallel the data I've collected, then morphing more than once in a 24 hour cycle should no longer
    be a problem. Further study is still required. However, if successful, my next goal will be to find a freshwater trigger.
    This will no longer limit me to saltwater submergence and will greatly increase my area of coverage. The major obstacle
    is not to change from a simple shower or a swim in the pool. I estimate the completion of this goal to be anywhere from
    3-6 months.</p>


  <p>Speaking of obstacles, Morrigan McBride continues to confound me. Why I spared her life, as well as the life of Anita Fiore,
    goes against my greater nature. Fiore can be easily handled, she lets her large ego get in the way of her small brain.
    McBride is the conundrum. A conundrum I will solve, one way or the other.</p>

  <stage>She closes her book, sits up, and dangles both legs over the side of the boat. Her feet dip into the deep, blue water where
    a school of Dorado swim around and nibble at her toes.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> I wish I could stay out here all day with you but I need to take these medical supplies to my lair - then
    I have to go back and teach a Bio 101 class to a bunch of morons who think picking their nose is a scientific study</line>


  <stage>Erika slowly stands, sighs, and gets ready to set sail.</stage>

  <stage>On the second floor of the KCON building, Morrigan sits inside her stark, gray, undecorated cubicle and stares at the computer
    screen.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Unaware that she is singing out loud) I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream...</line>

  <stage>Gracie Takanachi quietly comes up behind her.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> I cannot make a single sound as you scream</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Startled) HEY, don't ever sneak up on my like that, I don't appreciate it!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Take it down a notch, Morri - everything's cool, everything's serene!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Sorry, I just don't like surprises</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Wow, are you ever in the wrong business</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (To herself) And the wrong town</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> You, Chickie, have a gorgeous voice - USE IT MORE - the club I spin at has Karaoke Tuesdays, you could
    win some serious cash, as well as, plenty o' pints for your pals</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Returning to her computer) I'll keep that in mind</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> What has you so deep in thought... and singing, no less?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> My... my story</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> (Looking over her shoulder) You've written two words</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I need to get it done</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> The school board thing, right?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Typing) Yeah</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Hell, that'll take you a half hour at most</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> True... it's certainly not a multiple homicide or a train wreck, now is it?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Things have been pretty calm around here the last few days</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> THANK GOD</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Feel like lunch?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I feel like doing some research into those murders</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> I know a way to do both - let me get my keys and we'll go</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Do you mind if we stop off and pick up my car on the way? - it's finally ready</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> But are you ready for the bill?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Grabbing her purse) Never</line>

  <image  b="0" h="327" w="179" src="../graphics/y1c10_ewdg.jpg" alt="Electrawoman and Dynagirl!" a="center"></image>


  <stage>The two go over to Gracie's cube. It is adorned with twinkle lights, a bamboo plant, a fish bowl, a calendar of half-naked
    firemen, and a gigantic poster of Electra Woman &amp; Dyna Girl. Morrigan studies each item intently.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> (Noticing) OK, you've been in my space nearly a dozen times over the last three days - the fascination
    should be waning!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I just find it... interesting</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Try decorating your own &quot;office&quot; - you've been here long enough now and there isn't even a plant
    on your desk</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I like to keep my personal life at home and my professional life at the office - no trinkets, no pictures,
    no plants!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> One little cactus will not kill you</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> But I will most likely kill IT - plants always die on me, like everything else in my life</line>

  <stage>Upon hearing this comment, Gracie playfully strides away from Morrigan as they walk through the halls. Jason Clark, a tall
    African-American man on crutches, hops over to them.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Hi Jason</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Jason</actor> Where are you off to, ladies?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Captain Dave's for some fish 'n chips - want to come with?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Jason</actor> Sounds good but I have to be in the editing bay for the next hour - could you bring me back some?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Sure thing</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> How's the ankle doing?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Jason</actor> Much better, thanks - are you learning your way around here yet?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Getting there</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Jason</actor> Don't worry, you will - I'll catch you two later</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Extra fries, right?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Jason</actor> (Hopping off) You got it!</line>

  <stage>The two petite women make their way to the KCON parking lot.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I like Jason, he's a cool guy - do you think he'd mind if I asked for his autograph? - my dad is a big
    college basketball fan and it would absolutely make his day</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> (Getting in the van) No, he won't mind at all - not everyone gets to make the game winning shot in the
    NCAA quarterfinals like he did</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Also getting in) Yes, but he probably wants to be seen as a sports reporter now</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> (Starting the engine) He'll still sign the autograph, trust me - so, what do you think about the rest
    of the crew?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Everyone has been really nice... Turner has exploited my train wreck situation as much as he could,
    so I don't see him anymore - I haven't seen much of Kylee, either</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Try looking in the stairwell or under Gates' desk</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I like Austin but if he asks me to do the &quot;weather dance&quot; with him one more time, I will kill
    Mr. Ortega... and I'm not a violent person</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Not yet</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Oh, and Dan calls me Sarah - is that because I mistakenly called him &quot;Don&quot; on my first day?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> No, he calls all the girls &quot;Sarah&quot; - it was the name of his favorite intern ... five years ago!
  </line>

  <stage>Morrigan shoots Gracie a perplexed look.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> He can't remember ANYONE'S name - so, he calls us &quot;Sarah&quot; and the guys &quot;Buddy&quot;</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> oookayyy</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> What about Claudia?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Besides introducing ourselves, Claudia hasn't really chatted with me yet - I'm a little sad since she
    is a major role model of mine since my first journalism class in high school</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> (Snickering) Just what Claudia wants be reminded of - how old she is</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I met her husband, Benjamin, he seems like a sweetheart</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> He is - and the best damn dentist in town - the two of them as a couple are quite funny to watch</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Why?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Claudia keeps her husband's balls in a big old mason jar labeled with bold calligraphy &quot;MINE&quot;
    - if she weren't married to Ben, I'd swear she'd be the first in line to an Indigo Girls concert</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Really?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> But she's not, Anita tried once and got a huge bucket of ice dumped on her sorry ass</line>

  <stage>The mental image causes Morrigan to chuckle.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> She and Ben are just like that, you know? - they like the role reversal - some men are happy cooking and
    cleaning while their women strut around like a roosters and slay the evil dragon</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> That's cool</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Hey hey for them - they have a long, solid marriage and their kids are well-adjusted, nice people... so
    unlike the other Martels!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I like Dr. Stephanie</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Well, she finally wised up and ditched that family, she's back to being a Gates now... which is only a
    small improvement</line>

  <stage>They arrive at the mechanic's and pick up Morrigan's car. She then follows Gracie along Via Royal to the Duquesa Bay Pier
    where they park and get out.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Starting to walk towards the pier) What are you waiting for, Gracie?</line>

  <image  b="0" h="200" w="319" src="../graphics/y1c10_wharf.jpg" alt="The Wharf" a="center"></image>

  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> (Looking around) Zach - he called and said he'd meet us here for lunch</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> You two are inseparable</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> We keep tabs on each other - neither of us wants to be scooped</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> It's LUNCH</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> IT'S WAR</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Winking) It's LOOOOOVE</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> WHAT? - ARE YOU WHACKED? - TAKE THAT BACK</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> You LOVE him, Gracie Takanachi</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> YOU ARE INSANE, MORRIGAN MCBRIDE - THAT BLAST DID SOMETHING TO YOU</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> My greatest gift, as well as my greatest curse, is the ability to read people - and I read Zachary &quot;Eyes&quot;
    Isaacson all over your heart and on your uterine walls</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> EEEEWWWW - THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY LUNCH</line>

  <stage>Zach pulls up next to them in a beat-up, silver hatchback.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> (Getting out) Nice 'Stang, M&amp;M... can I ride your pony?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Evil grin) Other carousels await you, dear boy</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> Huh?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> I'M HUNGRY, LET'S EAT, NOW</line>

  <stage>The three make their way towards Captain Dave's Seafood Shack on the pier.</stage>


  <image  b="0" h="110" w="300" src="../graphics/y1c10_captdaves.gif" alt="Captain Dave's Seafood Shack"></image>

  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> How's your car?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Fine now - the mechanic said he's never seen circuitry fried like that before</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> Hmm</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> Weird</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Very</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> Tell me, Lady McBride, what exactly does &quot;Penis My Tire&quot; mean?</line>

  <stage>Both women stop and look at him.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> Your license plate... PNSMYTR</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Rolling her eyes) &quot;Pen Is Mightier&quot; you jerk!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> Ah</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> I like Zach's interpretation better</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Big surprise</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> What does that mean?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Gracie</actor> (Running off) I GOT DIBS ON THE PINBALL MACHINE</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Zach</actor> (Chasing after her) HEY, I ALWAYS GO FIRST</line>

  <stage>All three enter the small restaurant through a side door. As Gracie and Zach entertain themselves with a game, Morrigan
    sits at a glazed wooden table and ponders the ocean from her window. A burly man with an auburn beard calls to her from
    behind the counter.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> Can I get you something, Miss?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Snapping out of her trance) Oh, I'm sorry</line>

  <stage>Morrigan goes over to him.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> Hopefully, one day, I can afford an actual waitress</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> If you do, please don't make her wear a humiliating uniform made of seashells</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> How about starfish?</line>

  <stage>The two share a quick laugh.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm guessing you're Captain Dave?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> Aye, aye - and you be?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Extending her hand) Morrigan McBride</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> (Shaking it) Right, the dog saver - what can I get you?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I'll have an order of fried clams, a side of slaw, iced tea... and some information, please</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> I can help you with the first three, I'm not so sure about the last request</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Gracie said you might know about the men who washed ashore on Celoso Beach?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> I didn't know them personally - but they're friends of a friend, that kind of thing - all of the
    local fishermen are taking up a collection to help the families out</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> That's very generous</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> (Handing her a basket of clams) I know they were doing something illegal at the time but you can't
    blame the families for their actions - everyone deserves a proper burial</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Sprinkling malt vinegar on her clams) Do you think you could arrange a meeting between me and one of
    the family members?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> You seem like a nice gal, Ms. McBride, but they don't need to deal with media vultures right now</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Look, I know how it is to lose someone you love - I just want to get a little information to figure
    this out so it won't happen again</line>

  <stage>The large man considers this for a moment as Morrigan quietly eats her clams.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> (Looking over to the pinball machine) You leave Fingers and Eyes behind and I'll see what I can
    do
  </line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> It will just be me, one on one - no cameras, I promise!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> Give me a number where I can reach you</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Writing her number on a napkin) Thank you - oh, one more thing...</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> Would you like some tartar sauce?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I would like to know about Aleta Oscura</line>

  <stage>Turning pale, Captain Dave looks around and motions for Morrigan to follow him into the kitchen.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> What do you know about her?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Her... so, it is definitely female?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> (Clearing the sink) The guys who have seen her say she has a nice pair of jugs</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Back up weapons, I'm sure</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> (Serious) You think?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> How long has she been here?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> There has been more and more talk about her over the last few months but sightings and stories about
    Darkfin... her ENGLISH name... have been around for years</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Do you remember when they first started exactly?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> (Laying out his catch of the morning on the table) Not real sure but I'll ask around</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> I'd appreciate that</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> (Taking out a fillet knife) You know, I agree with Darkfin's environmental concerns - no one likes
    a dirty hypo in their chowder - but she didn't have to kill those men, she could've disabled their boat, called the authorities,
    whatever - now, there are two widows and four kids without dads</line>

  <stage>With one swift move, he chops off the heads of two fish as Morrigan turns away.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Captain Dave</actor> I just don't believe in killing</line>

  <stage>The young woman exits the kitchen, finishes her iced tea and heads over to Zach and Gracie who are just getting ready to
    order.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Hey, you two, I have some errands to run - Gracie, I'll meet you back at the station and Zach, try reading
    Edward Bulwer Lytton sometime</line>

  <bar></bar>

  <image  b="0" h="104" w="162" src="../graphics/scu_biology.gif" alt="SCU Dept of Biology and Aquatics"></image>


  <stage>Within moments, Morrigan arrives at Santa Conchita University. She walks across the campus and enters a hall leading her
    to the Biology &amp; Aquatics Department. She catches Dr. Javier Sanchez on his way to class.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Dr. Sanchez, may I have a moment of your time?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> The new KCON reporter, correct? - it is lovely to finally meet you - we had an amazing weekend, did we
    not?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> You could say that</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> (Smoothing his hair back) Are you here to interview me?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Uh, not right now - actually, I'm here to ask you a favor</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> (Disappointed) Of course, what do you need?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Pulling out one plastic baggie with the Q-Tip inside) I was hoping you could run some tests on this
    and tell me exactly what it is</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> (Glancing at the contents) Where did you get the sample from?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Actually, I found it on the bumper of my trailer</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> (Looking at his watch) Interesting - I shall run some tests and have the results for you tomorrow - right
    now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get to class</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> Thank you, Dr. Sanchez</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> (Gently squeezing her hand) Please, call me Sandy... and let me know when you'd like to set up an interview</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Forced smile) Certainly</line>

  <bar></bar>

  <stage>Later, after his class, Sandy encounters Dr. Shelby Willis in the hall.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> Shel... do me a favor</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Oh no</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> (Taking Morrigan's sample out of his pocket) Please</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> NO NO NO - Javier Sanchez, I am NOT doing your work for you!</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> Look, I have to be at a meeting with all of the other department heads in a few minutes, I don't have
    time to do this myself</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Find the time - just like the rest of us - I have to pick up Calvin from school and get ready for the
    Feast of Orunmila tonight</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> It's a favor to KCON, we need them for good PR</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Shelby</actor> Sandy, I told you once, and now I am telling you a second time - I am NOT doing it - Erika is in the lab,
    have HER do it for you... good-bye!</line>

  <stage>Taking Shelby's suggestion, Sandy finds Erika working in the lab and cautiously approaches her.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> Doing something that requires your immediate attention?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Not looking up) Let me guess, you have something to do, you asked Shelby to do it for you, she turned
    you down, and now you're asking me</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> No, not at all... well, yes, maybe - could you?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> What is it?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> (Placing the baggie on the counter) Just a sample that needs to be run</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Still working on her project) What kind of sample?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> That's the question, I'm not sure what it is</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Tim is due in pretty soon, I'll have him test it</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> As long as it's done by tomorrow, muchas gracias!</line>

  <stage>As Sandy turns to leave, Erika finally glances at the sample and is immediately intrigued by it.</stage>

  <line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> Wait, where did you get this?</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Javier</actor> That new KCON reporter brought it over... I think her name is Maureen</line>
  <line>
    <actor>Erika</actor> (Clenching her teeth) Morrigan... Morrigan McBride</line>
