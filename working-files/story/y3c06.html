<h2>The Other Sides</h2>

<stage>Inside a darkened SCU laboratory, Erika is desperately 
 trying to find out more about the toxin that nearly killed her father. 
 Several experiments boil and bubble around her as she peers into a microscope.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> This is most definitely anemone based but there is a 
 secondary agent that I just cannot isolate... where have I seen this 
 before?</line>

<stage>Unable to concentrate, the von Meer daughter takes a 
 step back from her work and dials out on the lab phone. She hangs up 
 after one ring and then redials the number.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Remember the code - one ring, followed by three...</line>

<stage>Pacing between the adjoining Quartz Lake Inn suites, 
 Morrigan keeps one eye on Karl Sr. and another on a muted television 
 tuned to KCON. All of the window shades are drawn but enough natural 
 light creeps in to create eerie wall shadows. An already spooked McBride 
 switches on the bathroom light for peace of mind but her ringing cell 
 phone quickly shatters the mood. She counts the number of rings.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Hello?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> How are you doing?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Hi... better I guess - how are you doing?</line>

<stage>Erika does not immediately respond.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I know, stupid question - I only asked because... 
 because you looked really sick when you left here</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c06_erika_morrigan.jpg" h="410" w="810"> </p>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Don't worry about me</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Someone has to</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Stephanie is helping out</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Right</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I'm still working on the toxin</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Any luck?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Luck isn't what I need right now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> OK</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Look, I apologize for being brusque, I'm rather tired 
 at the moment</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Hey, I'm impressed that you even used the word brusque</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> How's my father?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Oh, right, your dad - he seems pretty much the same, 
 no drastic swings in his vitals</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Good - has he been lucid at all?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> No, I haven't even seen him open his eyes</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Is his temperature still at 101.6?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Checking something) Yep, it's been hovering around 
 that level for the last hour</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Is Big Joe still with you?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> The front desk needed him - he's very freaked by 
 the whole thing</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Aren't we all?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> But I think he'll come through - he's bringing me 
 back something from the kitchen soon</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> When he does, please ask him for some ice - wrap it 
 in some towels and place it under my father's feet and hands - it should 
 help</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I'll do that</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Dr. Gates will check in on you two later tonight</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What about you? - aren't you going to come over?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Once I find out what we're dealing with</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You will, I know it</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Um, I should get back to work then - I'll see you later</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Um... how's KJ doing?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I haven't seen him</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Joe told me that he's trying to hold it all together</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> For the sake of the company, I hope he does</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Joe also told me that Ona Rosa was over at the house</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> And so were a lot of other people - you only need to 
 worry about yourself and my father right now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Fine - but you can't stop me for worrying about you... 
 'bye</line>

<stage>Erika hangs up the phone and strains against an oncoming 
 migraine. She returns to her experiments but can't help scratching an 
 irritated side of her neck. There is now blood under her nails.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Dammit, what is going on? - one problem at a time, please</line>

<stage>Shelby Willis enters the lab and is not surprised to 
 find Erika there.</stage>

<line><actor> Shelby</actor> Girl, there is no problem in this room that is more 
 important than being at home with your kin right now</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> What are you doing here, Shel? - I thought Calvin had 
 a t-ball game?</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> He is with a sitter because I was at YOUR HOUSE and 
 that is exactly where you should be!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I will later - I need to finish this</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> HORSE APPLES</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Please, I can't get into this with you</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> Help me understand what is going on in that crazy blonde 
 head of yours</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Maybe this is how I deal with loss?</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> And maybe I'll sprout wings and become a ballerina</line>

<stage>Erika crinkles her nose and unknowingly scratches at 
 her neck.</stage>

<line><actor> Shelby</actor> (Noticing the red patch) Precious Miss, what in the 
 world is going on with your skin?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Nerves</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> (Trying to get a closer look) It looks like something 
 the CDC needs to see</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Enough with the drama, Shelby, I've had more than enough 
 lately</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> It's more than just welts, those look like scales!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It's dry skin irritated by a rash caused from nerves 
 and you're not helping!</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> Sorry child - I have some lotion in my bag but it looks 
 like you'll need more than a squirt or two</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> If you really... really want to help me, I could use 
 your advice on the slide under the electron microscope</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> (Taking a look) About time you asked for some assistance, 
 did it maim you to do so?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Let me know if you reach the same conclusions about 
 the levels</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> You know, I know you don't get along with Pauline but 
 your mother seriously needs you right now</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Checking some beakers) She has KJ</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> She needs her daughter, more than ever - she not only 
 lost her husband but the father of her children</line>

<stage>Erika does not comment. She continues to work on her 
 findings as Shelby does the same. Javier Sanchez rounds the corner and 
 is surprised to see both women at work. He ducks behind a door before 
 they see him and quietly observes the scene. Erika goes over to Shelby 
 to check her findings.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> You can't isolate it either?</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> Not yet but I know who would be the perfect person 
 to ask</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Nearly jumping out of her skin) Who?</line>
<line><actor> Shelby</actor> Sandy - yes, I saw him working on something like this 
 the other day</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> (Revealing himself) Ladies, did I hear my name mentioned?</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Back at the Quartz Lake Inn, Joe Tiszo is in the kitchen, 
 preparing a meal for Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor> Joe</actor> (Muttering under his breath) This is wrong, all wrong</line>

<stage>His sous chef overhears.</stage>

<line><actor> Chef</actor> Did you need more parsley?</line>
<line><actor> Joe</actor> I have to stop this before it gets out of hand</line>
<line><actor> Chef</actor> Are you alright, Mr. T?</line>

<stage>Joe suddenly leans against the sink and grabs his head.</stage>

<line><actor> Joe</actor> NO - I REFUSE TO LISTEN</line>

<stage>And with that, he rushes out of the kitchen. Back inside 
 her suite, Morrigan takes Karl Senior's temperature.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Crap, it's gone up to 102 - I wonder what's keeping 
 Joe?</line>

<stage>She lets out a small shriek as the elder von Meer suddenly 
 grabs her wrist and squeezes it.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Mr. von Meer?</line>

<stage>Karl flutters his eyes until they fully open. He regards 
 the figure before him.</stage>

<line><actor> Karl Sr.</actor> (Weakly) Are... are you safe?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> We're both safe... for now - how are you feeling? 
 - is there anything I can get you?</line>
<line><actor> Karl Sr.</actor> I'm so... so proud of you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Uh, I'm not Erika... I'm Morrigan - your daughter 
 will be here later</line>
<line><actor> Karl Sr.</actor> I'm proud... of both of you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What do you mean?</line>
<line><actor> Karl Sr.</actor> There's... more to come... so much more</line>

<stage>He slips back into unconsciousness.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Mr. von Meer? - Karl? - where in the hell are you, 
 Joe?</line>

<stage>McBride scans the room for a minute and focuses on a 
 plastic bucket.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I need to get that ice!</line>

<stage>Zipping up her jacket, Morrigan throws the hood over 
 her face and puts on a pair of dark glasses.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> It's only down the hall... it's only down the hall</line>

<stage>With bucket and key card in hand, Morrigan carefully 
 peeks past the door to make sure no one is around. She dashes out and 
 hurries along the corridor to where she thought the ice machine would 
 be.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> DUH, it's on the floor BELOW this one - of course 
 - why must I always suck at numbers?</line>

<stage>Ducking an on-coming maid's cart, Morrigan slowly and 
 carefully creeps down to the other level. Two guests wait for the elevator 
 causing McBride to wait for them. Moments later, she is safely at the 
 ice machine filling her bucket.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You would think a place like this could afford ice 
 in every freaking room</line>

<stage>As she turns to leave, Morrigan can't help but feel she 
 is being watched.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (To herself) STOP IT, you are just being paranoid</line>

<stage>Climbing the flight of stairs, Morrigan feels a presence 
 gaining on her.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Filet O'Fish, is that you playing hide 'n seek?</line>

<stage>There is no response. Morrigan pauses at the door to 
 her level and waits. A figure in a blue robe now comes up the stairs 
 towards her.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> NOT YOU CREEPS AGAIN</line>

<stage>With all her might, the petite woman hurls the bucket 
 of ice at the figure and tries to fly out the door. It is now mysteriously 
 locked. The hood steps over the bucket and comes right up to Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Holding her key card up for defense) WHAT DO YOU 
 WANT FROM ME?</line>

<stage>The figure pulls the hood back to reveal itself.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> AMY?
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c06_amy.jpg" h="410" w="458"></p>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> They have him</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Outside the PCOC board meeting, an astounded KJ stares 
 blankly at the wall as Griffin and the other members pass by. Several 
 people offer condolences to the von Meer son and then head off in another 
 direction.</stage>

<line><actor> Griffin</actor> That went much better than I had expected... so, what 
 are your thoughts, Kage?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> I think I need a beer</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> This is a moment of glory - it should be toasted with 
 a bottle of the best champagne</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> I'm still trying to grasp what we are celebrating</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> It will make more sense when you study the files and 
 I expect you to stay late and do so</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Man, I need to go home... be with my family</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> THIS is how you can be there for them - right now, 
 we're on schedule and everything is going smoothly for once</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> My father just died and now you're talking about some magic 
 mystery metal that's going to revolutionize the world?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> It's going to turn the almighty oil cartels into yesterday's 
 news</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Do we need to destroy a mountain rage and the bay floor 
 to get to it?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> A hill here, some fish there - in the overall scheme 
 of things, it's called progress</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Rubbing his head) I really need that beer</line>

<stage>Observing from the conference room, Judge Victoria Martel 
 ambles over to her brother and KJ.</stage>

<line><actor> Victoria</actor> Don't forget, Grif, father expected you to call him 
 as soon as the meeting finished</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> (Scowling) Yes, I am aware of that... I'll be right 
 back</line>

<stage>The middle Martel brother rushes off as Victoria smirks 
 and gives KJ a large hug.</stage>

<line><actor> Victoria</actor> How are you doing, junior?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> I'm trying to find the words right now</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> I'm so sorry about Karl</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Thanks</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> Need a beer?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Oh yeah</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> Let's go get one</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> First, could you please explain to me how and when all 
 of this happened and how we... how you got caught up in it?</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> We'll need more than one beer</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> I mean, you of all people, Vic - you're as tough as my 
 sister when it comes to the environment, I certainly did not expect 
 to find you at this meeting</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> (Looking down the hall) Believe me, this is the last 
 place I want to be</line>

<stage>She nods for him to come closer to her.</stage>

<line><actor> Victoria</actor> (Barely above a whisper) Do you remember the Duquesa 
 Bay legends? - and I'm not just talking about the romantic one involving 
 the beheaded monk and his royal mistress...
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c06_victoria.jpg" h="410" w="483"></p>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Sort of</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> Well then, forget Griffin's files for now - I highly 
 recommend you go back and reread the history of this area</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Don't you think I have enough to do besides chase after 
 fables?</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> Keep an open mind</line>

<stage>A distraught KJ leans back against the wall and inhales 
 deeply. Victoria takes his hand and gently pats it.</stage>

<line><actor> Victoria</actor> I honestly did not want you to get tangled up in 
 this greedy web of havoc - I didn't want my brother or Meeramar or our 
 families involved... but we no longer have a choice</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> What do you mean we don't have a choice? - we always have 
 a choice!</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> Not this time, KJ</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> That's bullshit</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> Listen, my preferred piece of advice to you is to 
 run... to run as far and as fast as you can get - believe me, I tried, 
 but I also know what's coming and there's no way to get away from it</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Jesus, Vic, you're making it sound like the freaking Death 
 Star is upon us - sorry, Yoda, I need to go home to my family and crack 
 open a cold one</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> And that's exactly why I stayed in this - to protect 
 MY family</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> From what?</line>
<line><actor> Victoria</actor> With your father gone, you need to sprout a large 
 hairy pair of your own - watch your back, watch your mother's back - 
 and especially... your sister's!</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>At the von Meer estate, Lydia and Penny Renselier are 
 the only ones remaining to keep Pauline company. Dr. Stephanie Gates 
 drops by to check up on things.</stage>

<line><actor> Pauline</actor> (Clutching a bible) Thank you for being here, Liddie</line>
<line><actor> Lydia</actor> (Clutching her crutch) I flew back the minute I heard 
 what happened</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> (Under her breath) Not because your own daughter was 
 nearly killed in an earthquake</line>
<line><actor> Lydia</actor> I'm sorry, sweetie?</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Nothing... can I get you some water, Mrs. von Meer?</line>
<line><actor> Pauline</actor> Thank you, Penelope, it's nice to know I can count 
 on you when I can't even count on my own children</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> (Getting up) Yeah</line>

<stage>Penny traipses down to the kitchen where she finds Dr. 
 Stephanie sniffing at a plate of cold cuts.</stage>

<line><actor> Penny</actor> You'd get a better high off of a Sharpie</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Oh, Penelope - you startled me!</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Sorry, I had to come down for some water... and some 
 air</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> You don't... you don't do that with pens, do you?</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Relax, doc - I learned my lesson eating paste as a child</line>

<stage>Stephanie stares at her.</stage>

<line><actor> Penny</actor> That was a joke</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> This is not really the time for jokes</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Maybe it is - I know the biggest joke of all is going 
 on upstairs with Rikka's ma humping her bible like it's going to bring 
 back her dead husband or something
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c06_penny.jpg" h="367" w="365"></p>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Maybe it brings her comfort</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Like when was the last time she was in a church? - when 
 was the last time she did something for someone else that wasn't self-serving?</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> That's not the point</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Of course not, hypocrisy never is!</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Are we talking about Erika's mom... or yours?</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Heh, might as well throw them all in the same pool... 
 of course, we'd have to put floaties on my mother, first</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Such a cynical young girl</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> I like &quot;jaded realist hottie&quot; better - when 
 a big scary problem comes along, I don't go running back to childhood, 
 desperately clinging to myths to solve my problems for me because I'm 
 too stupid to think for myself - for Pauline, it's the New Testament, 
 for my mom, it's Cinderella... what's your pick, Auntie Steph?</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> I don't have a pick</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> See? - you're a woman of science, you know better</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Science doesn't solve everything</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> It solves enough</line>

<stage>Penny goes to grab something out of the refrigerator 
 and hums to herself as she does.</stage>

<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> (Thinking out loud) You have his exact same habit</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Excuse me?</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Oh... um, a man I know does the same thing - hums 
 to himself when he's upset</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> What makes you think I'm upset?</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> A mother can always tell</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> (Snapping open a bottle of water) Heh, that's not what 
 Brad told me</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> What does that mean?</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> It means we have some issues with our so-called families</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Young lady, you are very fortunate compared to a 
 lot of other girls your age who are simply struggling to survive</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> I know, believe me, I know - I feel the pain of the 
 universe the very second I open my eyes</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> No, Penelope, you know the pain of your sheltered 
 existence being challenged by unfair circumstances</line>

<stage>Penny raises an eyebrow at the woman who does the exact 
 same back at her.</stage>

<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> I am sorry about your mother's condition and I know 
 the situation with your father is less than ideal but they are here 
 for you and they both love you dearly... surely even you can see that?</line>

<stage>The goth girl thinks for a moment. Lydia comes to the 
 head of the staircase and looks down towards the kitchen.</stage>

<line><actor> Lydia</actor> Penelope?</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Yo, what up?</line>
<line><actor> Lydia</actor> Stop talking like you're black, you weren't raised in 
 a ghetto - are you bringing the water or not?</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> It's on the way</line>
<line><actor> Lydia</actor> Please hurry, Pauline is parched</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Ooh, alliteration</line>

<stage>Stephanie and Penelope watch Lydia struggle back to Pauline's 
 room.</stage>

<line><actor> Penny</actor> Be careful where you're walking, mom!</line>
<line><actor> Lydia</actor> Yes, dear</line>

<stage>Penny turns to go upstairs but pauses.</stage>

<line><actor> Penny</actor> (Looking back at Stephanie) You know, the absolute best 
 and worst day of my life is yet to come - when mom finally dies, it 
 will be a huge burden lifted off of my shoulders...</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> But?</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> But I don't want her to leave me</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> Your mother's love will always be with you, no matter 
 what</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> Maybe I don't want to leave her?</line>
<line><actor> Stephanie</actor> It's a natural part of life... to leave</line>
<line><actor> Penny</actor> (Lumbering up the stairs with the water) Yep, so I've 
 noticed</line>

<stage>Deep inside a cave, Amethyst leads Morrigan to where 
 the Clergy are holding their captive.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Whispering) You haven't said two words since we 
 left the inn, are you going to explain to me what's going on?</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> I can't</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Try</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> I don't have enough time</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> My foot is starting to hurt again</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> That's to be expected</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Why are you dressed like one of them?</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> Shh... we're almost there</line>

<stage>They come upon a chamber of stalactites and stalagmites. 
 In the middle of the polished floor lies a bound and blindfolded man 
 guarded by a cluster brown hoods.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Shocked) Zach</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> (Struggling against the ropes) C'mon, people, no one 
 told me what the safe word was - I'm all for a few rope tricks, I even 
 got some cowboy chaps in the closet but this is ridiculous - my circulation 
 is cutting off!
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c06_zach_in_distress.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Apparently, not to his mouth</line>

<stage>Morrigan goes in for a closer look as the white robed 
 leader enters the cavern.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Great, it's that supreme jerkoff again - so, what's 
 your plan besides trading me in for Eyes?</line>

<stage>Morrigan turns around to nothing. The sound of her own 
 breath fills the air.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Amy... Amy?</line>
