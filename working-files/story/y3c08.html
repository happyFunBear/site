<chapter-title>Murderer of Calm</chapter-title>

<stage>A car speeds along the darkened road to 
 the Quartz Lake Inn. It nearly loses control as it pulls into a parking 
 space just outside of the back entrance. Dr. Stephanie Gates tumbles 
 out of the door with a large cooler bag tucked under her arm. She tries 
 not to draw too much attention to herself as she lightly sprints through 
 the lobby and down into a closed kitchen.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Into phone) I'm inside
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (on the other end) Good - you 
 have everything you need, just follow my exact instructions on how to 
 prepare it</line>

<stage>Pans clatter and bottles clink as the antidote 
 to Karl Senior's toxin is spread out on a baking table.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Frantically mixing) Are you sure this 
 will succeed?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I double-checked it - we don't have time 
 to run another test</line>

<stage>A harried Stephanie knocks over and glass 
 and it shatters on the floor.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> DAMN</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> THE SERUM</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> It's fine, it's fine - it was just 
 a glass of water</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No one heard you?</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Peering out from the shuttered window) 
 All clear</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Keep going!</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> How did you find the solution?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Growling) Sandy lent a hand</line>
<line><actor>Stepahine</actor> Sandy? - who's... wait, Dr. Sanchez? 
 - does he know Karl is alive?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No, he was too busy helping me to ask questions</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Dear God... IS HE THE ONE WHO TRIED 
 TO POISON YOUR FATHER?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No... not directly</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Then he must know who - who is behind 
 this?</line>

<stage>Unable to utter the name of Stephanie's 
 son, Erika swallows her voice.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Erika? WHO DID THIS?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> That's not important right now - you need 
 to complete this - QUICKLY</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Filling a syringe) I'm just about 
 done</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Get to his room - the serum has to be administered 
 at exactly 3.4 degrees below his body temperature</line>

<stage>Stephanie packs up the bag and, with phone 
 in ear, makes her way out of the kitchen. The hardwood floor of the 
 lobby suddenly shakes under her feet.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Freezing where she is) Ooh - Erika, 
 are you still there?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I felt it, too</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> So many little aftershocks</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Muttering) Those aren't aftershocks</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> What?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Nevermind - keep going</line>

<stage>Running up the stairs, Stephanie reaches 
 Karl's suite. Before she goes inside, she pauses at the large picture 
 window to the side of the staircase.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> What the... ?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> WHAT'S HAPPENING?</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Forgive me, I was just startled by 
 something - I'm going into his room now</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Tell me what you saw!</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Are you near a window?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Yes?</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Look outside and tell me what you see...</line>

<stage>There is a long pause on the end of the 
 phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Am I imagining it?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> How... how did we go from a waning 
 gibbous moon last night to a waxing crescent moon tonight?
</line>

<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/y3c08_bloodmoon.jpg" h="344" w="510"></image>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> The cycles are off</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> And what is that red glow around it?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Concentrate on my father, Stephanie, PLEASE</line>

<stage>Stephanie checks out an unconscious Karl 
 and prepares to give him the antidote to the toxin.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> I'm ready...</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Do it!</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> I wish you were here... I'm nervous</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> You'll be fine... he'll be fine</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> I still don't understand why you're 
 not here?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'll be there as soon as I can... call 
 me back if anything changes</line>

<stage>In a darkened room lit only by a roaring 
 fire, Erika reclines in a plush leather chair and closes up her cell 
 phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> I need to settle something, first</line>

<stage>Moments later, a smiling Griffin enters 
 to room.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Loosening his tie) Well, hello there!</line>

<stage>He kneels down beside her and runs his hand 
 up along her leg.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> This... this has been a glorious day 
 - and it will be an even more glorious night!</line>

<stage>Erika only answers him with a stare of steel 
 as he nestles his head in her lap.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I want to come home like this every night, 
 Rikka</line>

<stage>She gently strokes the side of his face 
 and then wraps her hands tightly around his throat.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>The insides of the Kiyomis sway and rumble 
 as the hoods scatter in every direction. Chunks of rock break and shatter 
 to the ground as the leader of The Clergy rises up to meet the threat 
 of the black-robed Joe.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> For someone who was more than content 
 to cower away for so long, why must you interfere now?</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> My fears will no longer save me - I have 
 nothing and everything to lose</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> And lose you will!</line>

<stage>The leader hurtles through the air and aims 
 right for him. With an unconscious Morrigan slung over his shoulder, 
 Joe is able to dive away and counters with a well-thrown stone. It meekly 
 bounces off the leader as Joe scurries into a tunnel.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> (Calmly following after them) Sticks 
 and stones... honestly, Tiszo, I am disappoin...</line>

<stage>Before the leader can finish, it is blasted 
 with an energy wave and slammed sideways into the other side of the 
 tunnel.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> You forget who trained you?</line>

<stage>Joe runs off and hides Morrigan inside an 
 alcove. Knowing there is no immediate escape, he returns to the main 
 cavern and stands before the struggling leader.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> Arrogance has always been your Achilles</line>

<stage>The leader lunges to its feet and sends 
 Joe flipping into the air. It catches him and bone crunches him to the 
 ground.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> And not being able to kill when you 
 should have is always yours</line>

<stage>A gush of blood pours from Joe's mouth as 
 he regains his composure.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> Kill me if you must but your ever-present 
 impatience has already doomed you</line>

<stage>Joe looks up to a gaping hole in the ceiling 
 of the cave.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> It has already doomed us all</line>

<stage>The leader also looks up to the black, blood-rimmed 
 moon and the star-filled sky.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Such a pretty night, don't you think?</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Gasping) FOOL... you have initiated the 
 final cycle too soon!</line>
<line><actor>While Robe</actor> (Pinning Joe's neck with its foot) 
 I no longer wish to wait... it's not convenient</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> You know as well as I do the reason WHY we 
 had to wait for the specific alignment</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Scrawlings in old books are no longer 
 relevant - the Marked One HAS shown is where the vein is - now, we start 
 drilling</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> She still has a purpose beyond being your 
 compass</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> I thought so as well - but since neither 
 one of you will leave these caves alive, we will have to find an alternate 
 solution</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Straining in vain to free himself) You may 
 be... the victor in this battle... but she... will ultimately... stop 
 you</line>

<stage>The leader chuckles as it exerts more force 
 on Joe.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Who? - my daughter? - she doesn't 
 possess one-third of what you or I have... although I am proud of her 
 for trying</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> I speak of the other</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> A half-dead Marked One? - she, like 
 you, will soon be buried in these ruins</line>

<stage>As if to emphasize the leader's remarks, 
 the caverns shake and bellow again.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> You know to whom I refer</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Certainly not those pests in the military 
 - they'll be lucky not to blow themselves up - ah, and that leaves our 
 lovely green sea creature... no, Aleta Oscura is not an issue - she's 
 an anomaly and like all anomalies, she will vanish as quickly as she 
 appeared</line>

<stage>The leader now reaches under its robe and 
 pulls out a large, ceremonial dagger.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> No, Brother Tiszo, there is no one 
 left to interfere with the cooking - the table has been set - it is 
 now time to feast and relish the beginning of a new age!</line>

<stage>Before it can plunge the knife down into 
 the belly of Joe, another large tremor violently shakes the ground. 
 Summoning every last ounce of his rapidly draining strength, Joe throws 
 off the leader and runs off towards Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> Help me, Deirdre, for I only have one choice...</line>

<stage>He gathers the limp Morrigan from where 
 he hid her and runs towards another cliff inside the caverns. Joe takes 
 off his crystal necklace and quickly ties it around Morrigan's neck.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Kissing her on the lips) She will find you</line>

<stage>Joe hurls her body down into an underground 
 river. As he watches Morrigan float away on the current, the dagger 
 bursts through his neck.</stage>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> I am tired of this game, brother... 
 it has now come to an end!</line>

<stage>The leader pulls back the bloody blade as 
 Joe slumps to the ground. It searches the murky waters for Morrigan 
 but she has already gone. The caverns shake again. This time, it does 
 not cease. A blue robe hurries over to the leader.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> (Panicked) Master, the walls are collapsing 
 - we must leave before we are trapped!</line>

<stage>The leader gives one final glance at the 
 river and then walks away.</stage>

<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> Our compound... it's being destroyed!</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Do not fret - we will find a new place 
 to gather</line>
<line><actor>Blue Robe</actor> But drilling will be more complicated</line>
<line><actor>White Robe</actor> Wrong - we now know exactly where 
 to start - tonight has been most successful</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Back at the Quartz Lake Inn, Stephanie takes 
 a deep breath and then injects Karl with the serum.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Withdrawing the needle) Please work, 
 please work, God, please work...</line>

<stage>There is no reaction.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> C'mon, c'mon... what if it wasn't enough?</line>

<stage>Karl suddenly starts to stir.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> YES - that's it - fight, Karl, FIGHT</line>

<stage>He gasps. He thrashes. His eyes fly open 
 as an inhuman scream echoes from his mouth. A bewildered Stephanie slowly 
 backs away. After another minute of twisted agony, a suddenly peaceful 
 Karl falls back against the pillow.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Inching closer) Karl?</line>

<stage>She checks for a pulse and finds none.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> NO - PLEASE</line>

<stage>She begins chest compressions.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> ERIKA, WHERE ARE YOU?</line>

<stage>As she delivers mouth to mouth, Karl slowly 
 opens his eyes and smiles.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Karl?</line>
<line><actor>Karl</actor> (Weak) You haven't kissed me like that in 
 a long time</line>

<stage>Stephanie bursts into tears, gathers Karl 
 in a hug and then lets out a huge sigh of relief.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Don't EVER do that to me again!</line>
<line><actor>Karl</actor> Is... is she safe?</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Erika will be here soon</line>

<stage>Karl starts to say something but a look 
 of sheer horror crosses his face. Stephanie follows his eyes to a blue-robbed 
 figure swiftly approaching them.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Covering Karl) WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? 
 - GET BACK</line>

<stage>It pauses at the foot of Karl's bed.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Grabbing a syringe) YOU DO NOT WANT 
 ME INJECTING THIS INTO YOU, TRUST ME</line>

<stage>The figure slowly pulls the hood away from 
 its face.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> HECTOR?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Joe is dead</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> WHAT IS GOING ON?</line>

<stage>With a blank expression, he points to the 
 window. Stephanie looks outside and is blown away by what she is witnessing.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> That... that can't be!</line>
<line><actor>Karl</actor> What... what is happening?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> We need to leave... NOW</line>

<stage>Frozen in place, Dr. Gates still stares 
 in disbelief out the window. In the distance is an erupting volcano.
</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Erika continues to choke Griffin as his 
 eyes bulge out and his face turns red. Unable to deliver the final blow, 
 she throws him across the room. He crashes into the bookshelves and 
 slumps down to the floor.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Wheezing) Wh... why?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Approaching him) Why is the blood of MY 
 FATHER on your hands?</line>

<stage>A stupefied Griffin shakes his head as he 
 scrambles to his feet.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Did you really think I would not check 
 the autopsy results myself?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Holding up his hand in defense) I... 
 I have no idea... what you're talking about!</line>

<stage>Erika grabs him on both sides of his face 
 and pulls his eyes within inches of her own.</stage>

<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/y3c08_erika_griffin.jpg" h="376" w="410"></image>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> TELL ME TO MY FACE THAT YOU DID NOT POISON 
 HIM</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> POISON? - GOD ALMIGHTY, NO - look at 
 me, Rik, you know me better than ANYONE, you know when I'm lying - AM 
 I LYING TO YOU?</line>

<stage>The von Meer daughter releases him and tries 
 to hold back the tears.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (In tears) HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK... 
 I love you - I have loved you since the second we met - I would NEVER 
 EVER do anything to harm you or your family</line>

<stage>Erika turns away from Griffin and paces 
 the floor.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> What insane notion would ever cause you 
 to think differently?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Facing him again) THE TEST RESULTS, RIF 
 - THEY DON'T LIE</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME SO I CAN UNDERSTAND</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> My father's meal was deliberately poisoned 
 at the club - the toxin that was found in his system WAS COMMISSIONED 
 BY YOU</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> That's not possible</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> JAVIER SAID SO</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Sanchez?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> You do remember your little side project 
 with him?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> It's only an ingredient... for Ursula's 
 new cosmetics line</line>

<stage>Griffin suddenly covers his mouth as a look 
 of shock runs across his face. Erika reads his emotions.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> If you didn't do it, then you damn well 
 know who did!</line>

<stage>Before Griffin can utter another word, Erika 
 clutches her chest and drops to her knees.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> MORRIGAN</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Morrigan? - what does McBride have to 
 do with this?</line>

<stage>Erika ignores him and staggers over to the 
 window. The exploding volcano lights up the entire Kiyomi range.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> IS THAT MOUNT WIGGINS? - IT'S BEEN DORMANT 
 FOR 2000 YEARS</line>

<stage>Griffin is mesmerized by the sight. He finally 
 turns to Erika but she is already out on his rooftop patio.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> RIKKA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</line>

<stage>She sheds her clothes and takes an elegant 
 dive off of the railing. Erika plunges 20 stories into the delta of 
 the Santa Conchita River.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> ERIKA</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>With Joe's crystal necklace glowing bright, 
 Morrigan's lifeless body is carried out of the underground caverns by 
 the current and down the Santa Conchita River. She can feel the cold 
 water that surrounds her but is unable to move. A cacophony of voices 
 resounds in her in head.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Forgive me</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Don't give up - it is not the time</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> Someday, my darling daughter, you will 
 understand</line>

<stage>She now feels a presence wrapped around 
 her, filling her lungs with hot breath. Darkfin launches out of the 
 river with Morrigan in her arms.</stage>
