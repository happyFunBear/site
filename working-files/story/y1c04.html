<stage>Earlier that evening...</stage>


<stage>Inside the Santa Conchita University lab, Erika von Meer is asleep, slumped over her papers and books. Griffin Martel, styling in a charcoal gray Armani suit, enters and softly approaches the woman.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin Martel</actor> (Patting her shoulder and whispering loudly) Rikka... Rikki... Rikki Tikki Tavi, wake up!</line>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Groggy and groaning) Riff... what are you doing here?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (All cheerful) We have a dinner date, remember?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Uh</line>

<stage>Erika slowly rises and looks at her disheveled appearance in a mirror.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> EEH</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You look wonderful</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Fixing her hair) Liar</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes, but I'm good at it</line>

<stage>This elicits a small chuckle from the woman.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> I thought you had polo practice?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I did... it's over</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Looking at her dive watch) Whoa, I slept longer than I thought... OH NO</line>

<stage>Reaching into Griffin's vest pocket, she grabs his cell phone and calls home.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Father, I'm so sorry, I'll be home shortly and we'll work on the business then, I promise!</line>

<stage>Erika hands the phone back to Griffin, lifts her glasses and rubs her eyes.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Work can wait, we've got a dinner to eat</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Actually, that sounds pretty good</line>

<stage>Griffin's cell phone goes off.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Hello? - how's everything going? - EXCELLENT - you have a wonderful evening, I know I'm going to enjoy mine... goodbye!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Heading for the exit) I feel like fish</line>

<stage>With his hands folded behind his back, Griffin follows.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Well, my enjoyment level just dropped a notch</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>At the Samurai Sushi Bar, overlooking beautiful Duquesa Bay, the stately blonde pounds down tuna and salmon sashimi as the swarthy gentleman in her company picks at his marinated octopus.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Watching Erika voraciously eat two more slices) Rikka, darling, even though I have no idea why you like this little hole in the wall, we're still in public... must you eat like a pig?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Dipping another slice in wasabi) Suddenly, I hear my mother's echo in here</line>

<image   b="0" h="192" w="200" src="../graphics/sushi.gif" a="center" alt="Sushi"></image>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Well, if Pauline WERE here, she would be correct in making that statement</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> &quot;Must you eat like a pig?&quot; is an interrogative, not a statement</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Joshing) And I invited you to dinner again... why?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Good question!</line>

<stage>The two laugh and regard each other for a moment.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> I apologize if my dining habits are a little extreme tonight, this is the first time in days I've had a real appetite</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You need to take better care of yourself</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Mmm-hmm</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Where were you last night? - and don't say &quot;at the lab&quot; because you weren't</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Drinking some saki) Are you stalking me, Riff?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I'm just curious... you weren't at your family's, you weren't at the lab, you weren't on your boat... where were you?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> If you must know, I was at the research facility on Concha Dos - am I free to go now, Officer Martel?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Leering) Maybe I need to handcuff you to the bed</line>

<stage>Erika stares at him blankly.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Sorry... but you are spending too much time at work</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> You know, I just had this conversation with my mother and brother this morning, I really don't feel like repeating it</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Now popping a California Roll in his mouth) I'm just concerned, that's all</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> How was polo practice today?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Lacking, as usual</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Really?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Looking at his Rolex) I know Craig had more important matters to take care of but we absolutely have to find a better replacement for him</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What's wrong with Shelby?</line>

<image   b="0" h="248" w="235" src="../graphics/erika_headshot_new.gif" a="center"></image>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> She T-boned your brother in the third chukker!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Knowing KJ, he probably liked it</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Ms. Willis is not quite up to our standard of excellence</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Miffed) Because she's a woman or because she's black?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> This has nothing to do with her gender or her race...</line>

<stage>Griffin reaches under the table and squeezes Erika's knee.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Evil smirk) She's just not the player you are</line>

<stage>Erika casually flicks the man's hand off of her knee.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Looking at a TV in the corner of the bar) It's almost time for Craig &amp; Anita's Dog &amp; Pony Show</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Which one is the dog and which one is the pony?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I think they both tie for &quot;horse's ass&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Before that starts, just a small reminder that you and I will be attending Aunt Liddy's &quot;Etruscan Nights&quot; museum gala next week</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Is that so?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes, we will!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Lydia has worked very hard on this, I suppose I could go</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Penelope flat-out refuses to go unless you're there to suffer along with her</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Picking something out of her teeth) Heh</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Curt) Hopefully, you will have regained your manners by then</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> When did Sybil arrive at the table?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Looking at his watch again) I don't understand your reference</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Only a little bit ago, you're dragging me to dinner, now you're acting like you want to be anywhere else BUT here</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Don't be ridiculous</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Shh... it's time for the press conference</line>

<stage>Everyone strains to listen to the TV as sirens are heard in the distance.</stage>

<line><actor>Claudia</actor> (From TV) Good evening everyone, I'm Claudia Steel at the NewsCenter8 news desk, we're just receiving word of a breaking story - only moments ago, an east-bound freight train derailed past Riverbank Drive and the 101 intersection - there's no word yet on fatalities but we do know that several of its cars are on fire and some are apparently leaking oil into the Santa Conchita River - KCON has a news crew en route to the scene, we'll have more details for you shortly...</line>

<image   b="0" h="60" w="163" src="../graphics/kcon_logo_small.gif" a="center" alt="KCON NewsCenter 8"></image>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Jumping up from the table) I've got to go</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Don't let this ruin our dinner</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> THERE'S OIL LEAKING INTO THE RIVER, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT HITS THE BAY</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> What can you do? - you're not a fireman</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Rushing out the door) I'm going to the university, we'll need to set up a task force - YOU NEED TO GET TO THE OFFICE</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Rushing after her) Whatever for?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Whipping around in a fury) You know damn well that Meer-A-Mar cargo was probably on that train!</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> So what if it was? - our fathers can handle it</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Looking him directly in the eye) If you EVER hope to grow out of your Daddy Dougie's shadow at this company, YOU WILL HANDLE IT, Griffin</line>

<stage>Erika stares at the man as he realizes the truth in what she says.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Getting in his limo) Can I at least drop you off?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Sprinting off) It's just around the corner, I can make it faster on foot</line>

<stage>Running between buildings and down alleys, the woman heads as fast as she can towards the beach. Suddenly, she doubles over in exhaustion.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (To herself) Changing twice in a 24 hour period...</line>

<stage>Taking a few deep breaths, she sets her watch and puts it in her purse.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> I suppose now is a good time to find out if I can handle it</line>

<stage>Making sure no one sees her, Erika hurries along a jetty, strips off her clothes and dives into the ocean.</stage>
