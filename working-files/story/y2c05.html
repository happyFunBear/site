<chapter-title>Moonlight Observations</chapter-title>

<stage>Walking barefoot along the shores of Duquesa Bay, Morrigan McBride stares out to sea as nighttime joggers and dog walkers
  pass by. She glances down at her watch as the High Tide tickles her toes.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (To herself) Alrighty, Miss Mermaid, where are you? - I have been waiting for over a week now... it's
  not like we can just exchange e-mails</line>

<stage>She searches the waves and finds nothing. As a slight breeze begins to blow, the petite brunette suddenly feels a presence
  behind her and whips around.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Oh, Mr. von Meer... it's nice to see you again</line>

<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Ambling up to her) Hello, Morrigan - out for an evening stroll?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Something like that</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> It's good exercise, or so my wife tells me... I have to keep a watch on the old cholesterol</line>

<stage>Morrigan smiles as the man sighs and pats his stomach.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> I'm not interrupting you, am I?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Not at all, I'm just enjoying some quiet time</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Looking around) I don't see any handsome young man in your presence</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> KJ's taking me for a sail this weekend</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Who says I was talking about my son - AHA, go ahead and tell him I said that!</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Nodding) I'll be sure to do so</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Seriously, I'm a little concerned - it's not safe for a pretty young lady to be out here all alone, we've
  had some... incidents lately</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I know, I've been reporting on them</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> You sure have - great piece on the PCOC conference, by the way</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Thank you</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Do you have mace?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Uh, I appreciate your concern, Mr. von Meer...</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> KARL, please</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Karl - but my father's an LAPD commander, I learned self defense techniques before I could ride a bike</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> I'm glad to hear that but I still think you should have mace... or at least a German Sheppard</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I'll take that into consideration</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Good, I like you, more importantly, my son likes you - I want to see your smiling face at my dinner table...
  it would be a pleasant change from the usual female faces I have my dinner table</line>

<stage>Picturing a scowling Erika and her mother, Morrigan can't help but chuckle.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Speaking of which, I better get back home before Pauline comes after me with a net</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Annette?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> NO, A NET... literally - she'd grab the net off of the tennis court and hunt me down</line>

<stage>The older man becomes animated.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> KARL, I TOLD YOU TO BE BACK BY TEN, AAAARRRRGGGHHH</line>

<stage>As the senior von Meer contorts his face into a strangulation appearance, Morrigan is practically in tears laughing.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Heading off) Have a good night, little lady, and be sure to stop by the house more often - don't let
  the womenfolk scare you away!</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (To herself as she waves goodbye) It's not the womenfolk that scare me</line>

<stage>Once again alone, Morrigan tracks a bit further down the beach, finally resting near some dunes. Two hooded figures, covertly
  observing the woman, whisper to each other.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Hood #1</actor> Do you think she will appear tonight?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Hood #2</actor> She cannot keep away much longer - if she finally does, we are only to report back what we have witnessed</line>
<line>
  <actor>Hood #1</actor> I do not understand such logic</line>
<line>
  <actor>Hood #2</actor> It is not for us to understand, only to obey... I need to take my forward position</line>

<image  src="../graphics/y2c05_morri_beach.jpg" h="285" w="620" b="0"/>


<stage>Time passes as Morrigan dreamily regards the night sky and traces circles in the sand with her fingertips, unaware of the
  hooded figure a few yards away.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Softly) This is almost as peaceful as Montana</line>

<stage>Rising out of the surf, directly in front of her, is Darkfin.</stage>


<image  src="../graphics/y1c05_df_water.jpg" h="578" w="420" b="0" a="center"/>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Almost</line>

<stage>Darkfin saunters over to where Morrigan is sitting and kneels on the sand before her.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Scooting back) Holy Mackerel</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Actually, mackerel is only 0.2% of my DNA</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Heh, sorry - I should pay more attention to those &quot;identify the fish&quot; charts hanging in Captain
  Dave's Seafood Shack</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Eying the pattern Morrigan has made in the sand) Not a very effective sand castle</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Who says it's a sand castle... maybe it's the design for a sand castle</line>

<stage>The two stare at each other in silence for a moment.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Taking a deep breath) Sorry, I know you've saved my life but you still freak me out - Zach and Gracie
  are the sci-fi fans, this is all just a little too weird for me... especially with that nagging issue called murder</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> You call it murder, I call it depopulation</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> That's sick!</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Then, why are you here?</line>

<stage>Morrigan looks puzzled.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Why are you here waiting for me?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> OH, PLEASE... I enjoy taking walks along the beach!</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> You do not appear to be walking</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I am RESTING</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Starting to get up) My apologies, I shall leave you to your rest</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Grabbing Darkfin's arm) NO, WAIT</line>

<stage>Morrigan is momentarily mesmerized by the feel of the cold, sleek scales and notices a tiny electrical current pass between
  their touch. She is halted from exploring the arm fins as Darkfin draws back.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> My turn to apologize, I have a nasty curiosity habit</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> That can be good... and bad</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Well, since I have you here, I would like to ask you a few questions</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> I will answer yours if you will answer just one of mine</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Sounds fair - but I get to go first</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> That is reasonable</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> OK... where do you come from, what are you doing, when did this begin, why is this happening, how many
  others are like you and who in the HELL were those robe people in the cave?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Are you done?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> For this breath</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> I come from the sea, I defend those who cannot defend themselves, I was doing this before your arrival,
  I am the only one of my kind and I am not certain who the robed people in the cave are</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> THOSE ARE REALLY CRAPPY ANSWERS</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Maybe, but they are answers nonetheless... my turn</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Throwing up her arms) AHH</line>

<stage>Slowly reaching down, Darkfin clasps Morrigan's left ankle and rubs her thumb along the arch of her foot. The triskele mark
  glows at the touch as the petite brunette becomes warm and lightheaded.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> What is this?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Pulling her foot away) It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> A rather elaborate birthmark</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I know - my father wanted to have it removed but my mother insisted that I keep it... why?</line>

<stage>Darkfin now stands up and summons her trident. It comes flying out of the ocean and lands solidly in her palm.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> That's a nifty trick - I have one, too!</line>

<stage>Morrigan touches the tip of her nose with her tongue.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Impressive... be sure to put that on your resume</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I would LOVE to see your resume</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Twirling her trident) May I try something?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Heh, you haven't bought me dinner yet</line>

<stage>Plunging her fist into the shore, Darkfin pulls up several sand crabs and pops a few into her mouth. She offers one to a
  repulsed Morrigan.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> DISGUSTING</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Walking away) Do you not eat sushi?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> NO, I watch people eat sushi as I devour my well-cooked teriyaki chicken!</line>

<stage>Darkfin turns around and abruptly hurls her trident at Morrigan. It veers off at the last second as the woman screams.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I CAN LEARN TO LOVE SUSHI</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Returning to her side) We will work on your wasabi tolerance later</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Um, why did you just try to kill me?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> I was not trying to kill you</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> REALLY? - is that the new Nerf spear?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Even if you did not repel it, it would have missed your head by three centimeters</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm glad someone is good at math!</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> I needed to make sure</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Still shaking) Make sure of what? - why did I repel it? - I know I'm not in my best clothes tonight but
  there are no mountainous zits on my face</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Pointing to the trident) Try summoning it</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Excuse me?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> You heard me</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Do I whistle or should I use a piece of cheese?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Try suspending the sarcasm for five seconds and concentrate</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> You're serious</line>

<stage>Darkfin says nothing as she stares at the woman before her.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Sighing) I suppose I have nothing better to do</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Five seconds</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Folding her arms) FINE</line>

<stage>Closing her eyes and concentrating, Morrigan tries to summon the trident to her hand.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> It's not working</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Keep trying</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> WHY?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> I need to prepare you for a return to the caves</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> OH NO, nonononono - I have no intention of returning to those caves until I have a division of tanks with
  me</line>

<stage>With a slight twitch, the trident flies out of the sand and into Morrigan's hand.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> That will do</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Shocked) Did you do that?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> It was all you</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Regarding the beautiful weapon) It's so light... and warm - I don't understand?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Patience</line>

<stage>Behind a sandy knoll, one of the hooded figures observes the two of them. Darkfin sensed it long ago but deliberately ignored
  the situation until now.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Coming close into Morrigan's face) Remain still</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> What... what are you doing?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Not breaking eye contact with her) Remain calm</line>

<stage>Inserting her fingertips into both of Morrigan's ears, Darkfin lets loose with a concussive wave. The blow knocks out the
  hooded figure, as well as stunning its initiator.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Jumping up) WHAT IN THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Motioning to behind the knoll) We were being watched by our friends from the caves</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> DID YOU JUST... HOW DID YOU...</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Dizzy) RUN</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> THERE ARE OTHERS COMING, RUN</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> I CAN'T LEAVE YOU HERE</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> GO, NOW</line>

<stage>Darkfin pushes the woman forward and then hurls the trident into the ocean. Morrigan takes off running as she spots two hooded
  figures closing in behind her. Darkfin goes after them.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (At full stride) Mr. von Meer was right, I really wish I had some mace right now!</line>

<image  src="../graphics/y2c05_df_fight.jpg" h="483" w="420" b="0"/>


<stage>Tackling one of the hoods, Darkfin is sent flying into the sand by the other. All three continue to battle each other for
  some time.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (To the hood in front of her) This is pointless!</line>

<stage>A hood jumps directly in back of her.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Hood</actor> We'll see!</line>

<stage>Suddenly, a white Mustang roars along the surf's edge, flashing its lights and blaring the horn. The driver's door flies
  open and slams into the back of one of the hoods, sending him soaring into the sand.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> C'MON, LET'S GO</line>

<stage>Taking her suggestion, Darkfin flips onto the top of the vehicle and grabs a secure hold with her hands. With a sharp acceleration,
  the car fishtails in the sand and zooms off along the beach, leaving the hoods behind. Now back on open road, Morrigan
  finally steadies her breathing and racing heart.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Opening the moon roof) Dad told me to never pick up hitchhikers!</line>

<stage>Crawling in through the passenger window, Darkfin takes a seat in silence.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Did they hurt you?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Rubbing her eyes) What?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> Why are your ears bleeding?</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> Pull the car over on that bridge!</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> (Doing so) We need to talk some more</line>
<line>
  <actor>Darkfin</actor> (Jumping out) I need to leave... you need to return home</line>
<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> WAIT</line>

<stage>With one deft move, Darkfin dives off of the bridge and into the water below.</stage>

<line>
  <actor>Morrigan</actor> E-MAIL ME</line>
