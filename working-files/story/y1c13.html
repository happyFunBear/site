<h2>One Minute After Midnight</h2>

<p><img border="0" height="345" width="470" src="../graphics/von_meer_house.jpg"></p>


<stage>Inside the von Meer estate, Erika ruminates on her recent events as Darkfin while her fingers glide casually over the keys of a grand piano. Out of the corner, a cloaked figure in an iron, vulpine mask softly approaches from behind.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Not looking at him) You're early, Griffin</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Should I be flattered that you always know when I enter a room?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Continuing to play) Try toning down your cologne</line>

<p><img border="0" height="237" width="192" src="../graphics/griffin_headshot.gif" align="right"></p>


<stage>Lifting his mask, the most handsome of the Martel brothers curls one side of his mouth into a grin and takes a seat on the piano bench.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> As much as I enjoy Palestrina's &quot;Lamentation,&quot; we're going to be late unless...</line>

<stage>He looks disparagingly at her cut-off shorts and SCU sweatshirt.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You plan on going as a homeless person or a California native</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Slowing her hand movements) What's the matter, Rif, don't you want to be fashionably late?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Late, yes - miss half of the event, no - but, if you have something better for us to do in mind, I am more than willing to accommodate</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Rising) I'm afraid you'll have to accommodate yourself tonight, I'm not going</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Trying to subdue his anger) What, another whale to save?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> For once, it has nothing to do with my work... MOTHER</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> THEN, WHAT?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I don't feel well</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Feeling her cheek) Surely you can come up with something better than that</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> It's my time of the month</line>

<stage>Suddenly, Griffin grabs Erika's waist, bends his head and inhales deeply between her legs.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Funny, there's no scent of this</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Pushing him back) YOU PIG</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> And pigs have a brilliant sense of smell... and what I smell is another lie - tell me, what are you REALLY doing tonight, my love?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Anything but you</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Trying a new tactic) Lydia and Penny will be so disappointed if you don't come</line>

<stage>His words give pause to Erika as Karl Senior and Pauline von Meer enter the room dressed like Louis the XVI and Mary Antoinette.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Turning to them) My lord and lady, might I implore you to convince your fair daughter here to grace us with her presence and attend tonight's festivities... TO HELP THOSE IN NEED?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Who is the one in need, Griffin?</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Rushing over and grabbing her daughter by the ear) FOR GODSSAKES, ERIKA, THIS IS THE PREMIER CHARITY EVENT OF THE SEASON - WE HAVE A FAMILY NAME TO UPHOLD</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Family name or social standing?</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Tightening her grip) GRIFFY AND I AGONIZED OVER PICKING OUT THE BEST COSTUME FOR YOU</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I feel your pain</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> MOVE YOUR ASS, GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE BEFORE I GIVE YOU A REAL REASON TO STAY HOME</line>

<stage>The tall, blonde woman glares at her shorter mother and then to her father who looks at the floor.</stage>

<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> It is for charity, honey - besides, it's not like we all go out as a family every night</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Heading up the stairs) I wonder why</line>

<stage>She is met half way by KJ coming down the stairs as Superman.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Leaping to the bottom) DA DA DA - it's a bird... no, it's a plane...</line>

<p><img border="0" height="112" width="150" src="../graphics/y1c13_supes.gif" align="right"></p>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> YOU LOOK LIKE A FAGGOT, GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Kissing his mother on the cheek) And you look like a heartless bitch, even without the costume</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> KJ</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Still watching from the staircase) You are more than welcome to use mine</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> As much as dressing in drag would thrill our sweet mother, I need to keep this theme since my date will be going as Lois Lane</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Rolling her eyes) Oh, God</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Thinking for a second) Ms. McBride is still your date?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Yes - you sound surprised?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Resuming her course to her room) I am... I thought she had better taste</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Looking at his watch) Not that I don't enjoy the von Meer family bonding moments, but we all need to get going ASAP before the good caviar disappears</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Sighing) I'll be ready in five minutes</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Rushing out the door) UP, UP, AND AWAY</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Leaning on her husband's shoulder) It would have been easier breeding Weimaraners</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Patting her back) But not as much fun</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>At the Santa Conchita Lanes, Gracie and Zach enjoy a fine evening of &quot;Disco Bowling&quot; with their friends. As the lights twinkle around them and 70's dance songs blare from the sound system, Gracie takes a seat on the bench and stares at her shoes.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Grooving over to her) MORE MORE MORE, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? - 7/10 SPLIT, BABY, LET'S SEE YOU TOP THAT</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm sitting this frame out, Eyes</line>

<p><img border="0" height="215" width="200" src="../graphics/y1c13_bowlingpins.gif" align="right"></p>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Plopping down next to her) What's wrong?</line>

<stage>Gracie's date, Hal, and one of the Mirabello twins giggle over a gutter ball.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Watching them) Are you upset because Half keeps making eyes at Joenne?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> That's not bothering me... too much - I'm just pissed, that's all</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Pissed about what?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Looking him in the eye) Aren't you pissed?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> ABOUT WHAT?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> We've busted our asses in town for years and Morri is here less than a month and SHE gets to go to the ball?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I can't believe I'm hearing this - you're jealous of THAT?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> NOT jealous... pissed</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> You mean to tell me you would rather be there with a bunch of dressed-up snobs instead of here eating stale nachos, drinking warm beer, and sharing the company of moi?</line>

<stage>Gracie says nothing.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> OF MOI? - Fingers, I'm hurt!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> And I'm still pissed - I'm tired of being the &quot;Nobody of Duquesa Bay&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> That's not true... you're the eight-fingered &quot;Nobody of Duquesa Bay&quot;</line>

<stage>Justine Mirabello scores another strike.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> ZACHARY, GET OVER HERE, IT'S YOUR TURN</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Ignoring her) Look, the only reason M&amp;M got invited is because KJ wants to impress her and get her into bed, that's it</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I feel a little better</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Thought so - AND, I told him she was going as Lois Lane</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Evil grin) You ruined her surprise, that's mean!</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Well, I couldn't take the chance of him going as &quot;Spiderman&quot; - that would've been WRONG</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> ZACH, NOW</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Pulling Gracie's hand) C'mon, I can't deal with Justine's gloat-fest if she wins - move those boogie shoes and let's kick her ass!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> How about I buy you another round of warm beer instead?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> That might work just as well</line>

<stage>At her house, Morrigan puts the finishing touches on her hair and slips on the fake glasses. She admires herself in the mirror and then looks to a picture frame on her vanity that is wrapped with her rosary beads. It holds the image of her grandmother with her mother as a young girl.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan McBride</actor> (Fingering it) I miss you two</line>

<stage>A familiar knock is heard at the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Come in, Amy</line>

<stage>The door opens and a loud, piercing, screech fills the room.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Shaken) JESUS CHRIST</line>

<stage>Amethyst Hill shuffles in, all smiles, followed by two of her cats.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Do you think I'm an effective screamer?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Trying to catch her breath) WHAT?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> My friends say I don't scream very well</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Eyes wide) You scream fine!</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> YAY</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> What brought this topic of conversation up?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> We were discussing the Chilean farming industry</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Of course you were</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> WOW - you look really good, Morrigan - I still would prefer to see you in one of those expensive, elaborate gowns but that suit totally works!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Thanks, I hope this doesn't sound rude but do you mind keeping Roshumba and Amber outside? - this color is a cat hair magnet</line>

<stage>The slightly plump woman with the pixie face holds up the smoky, long-haired cat.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (East African accent) You, Ms. McBride, should be honored to carry my hair with you to your little soiree tonight - BUT, in deference to the woman who feeds me, I shall grant your request</line>

<stage>She places the cat outside and picks up the orange and white shorthair.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Squeaky voice) From what I've heard about KJ, my hair on your suit will seem like a blessing compared to other stuff</line>

<stage>Morrigan rolls her eyes as Amethyst places the cat outside with the other.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I appreciate it, Amy</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Just don't hold me responsible if a dead bird appears on your porch</line>

<stage>McBride's cell phone rings in her purse.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Answering it) Hello?</line>

<p><img border="0" height="78" width="51" src="../graphics/cellphone.gif" align="left"></p>


<stage>There is silence on the other end.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Is anyone there?</line>

<stage>A deep, eerie, male voice finally comes on.</stage>

<line><actor>Voice</actor>The shattered water made a misty din,<br>
 Great waves looked over others coming in,<br>
 And thought of doing something to the shore<br>
 That water never did to land before</line>


<p>The phone clicks off as Morrigan turns five shades of pale.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Noticing) What's wrong?</line>

<stage>The petite brunette turns the words over in her head.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Morrigan?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Um, nothing, it was a crank call</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> What did they say?</line>

<stage>McBride runs over to her bookcase, and searches her old college textbooks.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> What are you doing?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Trying to find my old poetry book - &quot;that water never did to land before&quot; DAMMIT, why can't I remember the rest of it?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> What poem is that from?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> That's what I'm looking for - the caller only recited the first few lines</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Sitting down) It came true!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Pausing) What are you talking about?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Ansuz came up for you today</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> What is Ansuz?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> It's the message rune - you need to be aware of meetings with people, both arranged and those that happen by chance!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> GIMME A BREAK</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> I'm trying to give you a warning</line>

<stage>The sound of a car pulling into the driveway is quickly followed by the doorbell. Morrigan opens it and is stunned to see KJ dressed as Superman.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> How did you know?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I'm SUPERMAAAAAN</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> For her sake, let's hope you're not faster than a speeding bullet</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Very cute, Amy, very original, too - are you ready, Lois?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Arms folded) Who told you, Gracie or Zach?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> The latter</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I should've known - KJ, how well do you know poetry?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Roses are red, violets are blue...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm serious</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> So am I - since I went to a private college, I didn't have to take any General Education classes for my degree - the little poetry I did learn in school left my brain the second the semester ended, why?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Taking his arm) Just curious - let's go!</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Have a good time, you two... and stay alert</line>

<stage>The woman with blonde cornrows picks up one of her cats and pets it as they drive off.</stage>

<p><img border="0" height="268" width="320" src="../graphics/y1c12_museum.jpg"></p>


<stage>At the Quartz County Museum, people bedecked in all sorts of elegant costumes begin to arrive. They are met by tight security and escorted to the Etruscan Antiquities Hall, the main chamber for the event. Lydia Renselier, dressed as a flapper, is speaking with the Mayor of Barcelona about the &quot;Duquesa's Tears&quot; pearl necklace on display. Her daughter Penelope sports the wings and looks of a devious dragonfly.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Searching the room with her eyes) I should've known Jere wouldn't show</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Smiling as the mayor walks away) Did you say something, darling?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> I said you have a nice turn out for this charade - is El Mayor pleased?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> He seems to be, he couldn't stop kissing my cheek</line>

<stage>Penny starts to say something but decides against it.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> I was slightly concerned that he might have a problem with the room</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Well, we couldn't really hold it in the modern art wing or the sculpture garden and the Native American cubbyhole barely holds a field trip class</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Wiggling one of Penny's wings) My thoughts exactly!</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Making a face) EWW</line>

<stage>A tall man with a curly dark hair and striking eyes makes his way over to them. He is dressed as a Southern Gentleman from the Civil War era.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> Daddy, so nice of you to show up!</line>
<line><actor>George Renselier</actor> (Kissing his wife) We're still trying to get enough votes to pass the irrigation bill - damn environmentalists keep getting in the way - you look lovely, Lyd, is that a statement of irony you're wearing?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Taking her crutch and hitting him on the behind) I thought you'd get a kick out of my interpretive Charleston</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Turning to his daughter) Hey pumpkin, you look all insect-like</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Huh, I was going for the marsupial look, guess I failed</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Can I get you ladies something to drink?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cathbert have been asking for you - we should go over there and say hello</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Good thinking, I could always use another campaign contribution</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Biting her lip) I'll catch up with you two later, I need to pee</line>

<stage>The Renselier daughter buzzes over to the bathroom as Pirate Craig enters the hall, followed by Anita the sulking bar wench.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita Fiore</actor> I so cannot believe I'm here... in THIS costume!</line>
<line><actor>Craig Phelps</actor> It flatters your tits and ass</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Smiling at a couple of women across the room) I should be offended by that statement but I'm not</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> That's why I said it</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> ONE HOUR, and then I'm leaving</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Taking some hors d'oeuvres from a tray) That's all I ask</line>

<stage>He looks around the room.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> Maybe we should've picked up your sister?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Stealing a shrimp from him) She called me and said Sandy was taking her for sure</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Trying to hide his disappointment) It's about time he acted like her husband</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Watching his reaction) Uh-huh</line>

<stage>Douglas Martel arrives with his wife, Ursula. He's in a hockey uniform and she's wearing a revealing Versace gold dress.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Looking around) Liddy did a great job putting this event together</line>
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (Sniffing) Not bad</line>
<line><actor>Doug</actor> I still think you should've dressed as a cheerleader</line>
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (A touch of her Slavic accent still intact) I dress up as a freaking alien for your TV show everyday - I want to look like a real woman at night</line>
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Ogling her up and down) And, you do</line>
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> Now that I have you aroused, Dougie, please talk with the writers tomorrow - I want Rojilio killed off</line>
<line><actor>Doug</actor> But everyone LOVES Rojilio!</line>
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> I know - his fan mail is starting to outnumber mine and his ego is out of control - it's time for R'xal to blow up his asteroid!</line>
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Sighing) I'll see what I can do</line>
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> Let's go say hello to the Mayor of Barcelona, he's an old friend of mine from the clubbing days back in Europe</line>
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Looking at his watch) You go ahead, I need to give my regards to a business associate</line>

<stage>As the guests mingle about the room, a shadowy figure runs across the museum rooftop and enters an air conditioning duct. Morrigan and KJ arrive at the ball, shortly followed by the von Meers, Griffin and Erika.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> This is pretty cool!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Still preoccupied with the phone call) Yeah</line>

<stage>They proceed to the main room and start to mix.</stage>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Aside to her husband) She looks ridiculous in that suit - is Ms. McBride too poor to afford a real costume?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Overhearing) Actually, I think she's the best dressed here</line>

<p><img border="0" height="287" width="189" src="../graphics/y1c13_erika_gown.gif" align="right"></p>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Scowling) KJ could've bought her something better</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> You're unhappy when a woman takes our son's money and now you're upset when one doesn't - let's get some champagne</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I'll go get some for all of us!</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> Thank you, Griffy</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'll just have some water, please</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> Erika, the alcohol might do you some good</line>

<stage>Lydia and George come over to them.</stage>

<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Shaking his hand) George, how's Sacramento?</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Flat and dry, with a lot of hot air... politics as usual!</line>

<stage>They all fake laugh.</stage>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Giving Lydia a hug) Honey, you should be so proud - this is a FABULOUS party you threw together - I'm able-bodied and I couldn't have done all of this!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Smiling meekly) What my mother means is... NICE JOB</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Winking) I know, Rikka - I'm really glad you made it, we never get to see you anymore</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I've been busy</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> If you figure out with what, please let me know</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Penelope has been asking for her favorite fish lady</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'll be sure to say hi</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> She's probably hiding in the bathroom</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Taking off) Smart girl</line>

<stage>On the way, Erika is suddenly stopped by the site of the Duquesa's Tears in a massive glass display case, surrounded by security guards. She peers closer at the three-strand choker of white and black pearls, held together by an emerald centerpiece. The seemingly silver clasp is what really has her attention. In the reflection of the glass, she detects the furtive glances exchanged by the guards.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Coming up behind his date with the champagne) It's pretty but I can have a necklace made for you that's 10 times more beautiful</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Taking the drink) You know I'm not into jewelry</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> If you stare at this piece any harder, you'll shatter the protective case</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Sipping) Hmm... remember that time in boarding school when we accidentally broke the window in that Belgian cathedral?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Slight laugh) Not one of our finer moments</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Yes, it was</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Is that a smile?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> It's the alcohol</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Then, by all means, let me fetch you some more!</line>

<stage>After circulating around the room several times and meeting Santa Conchita Valley's society members, Morrigan and KJ retire to their own little corner by a marble pillar.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I have to say, I'm having a wonderful time tonight, KJ, thank you for inviting me</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> It is my pleasure - everyone you've met is absolutely taken with you... as am I</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Deliberately ignoring the last comment) Well, when they weren't referring to me as &quot;that dog lady on the news,&quot; it was nice</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> We don't get a lot of heroes around here</line>

<stage>Lydia and George wave and start to make their way towards them.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> Actually, I take that back, here comes one now</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I bet she hates being called that</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> She does but it's true</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Kissing KJ) Sweetie, I'm so happy you're here and THANK YOU for that most generous contribution</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Hey, no problem - and I know it's going to a good cause!</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Taking Morrigan's hand and squeezing it) Ms. McBride - I see you're making your way around town</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Raising an eyebrow at the assemblyman) I enjoyed our interview the other day</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> It was mutually beneficial</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> You have a real presence before the camera, as well as, a wonderful way with words</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> How do you think he got elected?</line>

<stage>All four fake laugh.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Mrs. Renselier, I am deeply impressed with this museum, I understand you are the driving force behind it all?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Pretending to be modest while George shakes his head) Well, I don't know about driving force, but it is my passion, that's for sure</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Glancing at Mr. Renselier out of the corner of her eye) I find the sculpture garden to be the most enchanting</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> I absolutely agree, it is my favorite area, too</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Losing the smile on her face) Come, George, let's leave these two young ones in peace, we have to say a few words to the Braemars before they leave</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Of course</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> KJ, it was so nice to see ALL of the von Meers here tonight</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> It will probably be another year before that happens</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Ms. McBride, keep up the good work at KCON</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It was great meeting you, Mrs. Renselier</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Watching them walk away) It's not fair, George has all that hair at his age and mine is starting to recede already</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Something clicks in her head) You're a very handsome man, KJ, with or without... hair... hairy</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (All smiles) Ya think?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor>The clouds were low and hairy in the skies<br>
 Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Huh?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> DAMMIT, DAMMIT, HOW DOES THE REST OF IT GO?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Leaning against the pillar) Are you okay?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry, I'm just being weird - let's go get some more of those delicious crab cakes</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Lead the way!</line>

<stage>As they start to walk, his cape catches the lighting sconce on the pillar.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Here, let me get that for you</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Thanks, Lois</line>

<stage>As she unhooks the cape, a tiny, square piece of metal with circuitry falls to the ground.</stage>


<p><img border="0" height="174" width="260" src="../graphics/y1c13_circuit.gif"></p>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Looking around) I didn't break it!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Picking it up and examining it) Relax, Superman</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> If I did break it, I'll pay for it</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Checking out the sconce) I don't think it has anything to do with the light - it's not the same material and I can't find a place it would've fallen out of</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Then, toss it in the trash and let's go get those crab cakes</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Still looking at the square) It has to have some kind of purpose</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Does everything have to have a purpose with you?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Without missing a beat) Yes</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Ooh, Ona Rosa finally made it - let's go say hey</line>

<bar></bar>


<stage>In a small corridor leading to the restrooms way on the other side of the building, Penny Renselier dries her tearstained eyes with a rough paper towel and takes out a cigarette.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Struggling with her lighter) Fuck you, Jere</line>

<stage>Wearing leather chaps and dressed as a sheriff from the Old West, Bradley Martel ambles out of the bathroom, spots Penny and makes his way over to her.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Striking a match against his face and lighting her cigarette) You're too young to be smoking</line>

<p><img border="0" height="89" width="81" src="../graphics/y1c13_sherif.gif" align="right"></p>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Exhaling smoke at him) And you're too old to notice... Uncle Brad</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Taking her cigarette and smoking it) You're adopted, we're not blood</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Grabbing her cigarette back) So you keep reminding me</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> If you don't surrender... your cigarette... I'm going to have to arrest you</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Trying to burn him with it) You'd like that, wouldn't you?</line>

<stage>The younger Martel brother knocks it away, pulls out a pair of handcuffs and slowly rubs them across her lips. She snags them out of his hand and chucks them across the room.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> Go pick them up</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Make me</line>

<stage>Brad slowly uses his body to push her up against the wall. Not resisting, she allows him to feel her up.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Breathing heavily into her ear) Where's your boyfriend?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Looking off into the distance) Not here</line>

<stage>The two kiss wildly for a few moments.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Stopping him) If the concept of incest doesn't freak you out, how about statutory rape?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Fondling her breasts) I've been in jail for worse</line>

<stage>He takes her hand and guides it between his legs.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> Nice gun, Cowboy</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Pull the trigger... I dare you</line>

<stage>With one, swift move, the Renselier daughter knees him in the groin, sending Brad backwards to the floor.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> Bang</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Struggling to his feet and trying to catch his breath) You... little bitch... I'm going to nail you for that</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Lifting up her skirt) Nail it to the wall, babe... if you can</line>

<stage>Before Brad can reach Penny, Erika comes from around the corner and steps in front of him.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Bradley - it seems your brother Griffin is in need of entertainment this evening - why don't the two of you go off and play with yourselves?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Still looking at Penny) Rikka, what a surprise - you actually left the lab</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Getting in his face) Leave... now</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Hobbling off) I'll catch you later, Dragonfly!</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> No, you won't</line>

<stage>The girl gives Erika a huge hug.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> Glad you're here, Erika</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Still watching Brad) I'm sure you are</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Ah, I could've handled him</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> You're playing a very dangerous game, Penelope</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Taking Erika's mask and holding it to her face) It's my game to play</line>

<stage>Two guards walk by, look them over, and continue on.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Following them with her eyes) Tell me, is your mother using a different security force tonight?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> How the hell should I know?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Did you not help her with the arrangements?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> I suppose - I think the Mayor of Barcelona brought his own detail... why?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Just curious</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Since you're the only other person I know that's here that doesn't want to be here, could you please bust me out of this nightmare?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Your parents are here and I don't want you out alone with Brad wandering around</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Come with me to Vesper's house, you can help us with our math homework!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> That actually sounds like fun but I need to check something out</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Disappointed) Fine</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'll tell you what, go back to the Etruscan Hall, STAY AWAY FROM BRAD, and I'll drive you to Vesper's in about 20 minutes</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> COOL, THANKS</line>

<stage>Erika takes a deep breath and scans the rooms as she follows Penny back to the party. She runs into Captain Phelps and Lieutenant Fiore on the way.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Craig, it's a pleasant surprise to see you here</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> I could say the same thing, Dr. von Meer</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> With our jobs, I suppose we don't get to socialize that much</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> True</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Barely acknowledging Anita) Lieutenant</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Smiling at a cocktail waitress) Yeah, hi</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I was wondering, Captain, do you know any of the security guards here tonight?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> No, I don't see any of my guys or extras from the sheriff's department - why?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No real reason - have a good evening</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Nodding) Dr. von Meer</line>

<stage>He watches her walk away as the cocktail waitress returns Anita's smile.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> I wonder what that was about?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Licking her lips) What? - I wasn't paying attention to what she said</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Noticing the cocktail waitress) I thought you wanted to leave after an hour?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Watching the woman slowly make her way towards her) I found a reason to stay</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Looking over to Ona Rosa) I don't know which one looks more stunning tonight, Erika or your sister?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Jesus, between you and KJ drooling all over her, why don't you ask Oni out back and take turns doing her on the steps? - she would be appalled, at first, but then she'd get off on the attention of two REAL men</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Don't talk about your sister like that!</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Why? - she's not a fucking saint... well, maybe she is but I don't have to bow down to her, that's your fantasy</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Sizing up the cocktail waitress) And that's yours?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> She's bringing me oysters, what's MRS. SANCHEZ bringing you?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Funny, I would think you'd be crazy over the leggy blonde that just spoke to us?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Still watching the cocktail waitress) Erika von Meer is not just an iceberg, she's the entire continent of Antarctica and, as big of a blowtorch as I am, I know when to save fuel</line>

<stage>The cocktail waitress is now directly in front of them.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> Especially when there are tastier marshmallows to torch - later, Matey!</line>

<stage>The captain watches the two women leave and returns his attention to Ona Rosa. Mrs. Sanchez, dressed as a Native American shamaness, is surrounded by KJ, Morrigan, and her conquistador-clad husband, Javier.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> I swear, if it weren't for Ona Rosa's advice, I'd still be in the courthouse right now</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> You flatter me, Kage, the truth is this case had a lot of loop holes to close and we both found ways to close them in time</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> (Looking at his watch) How nice</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Dr. Sanchez...</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> Please, call me Sandy</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Sandy... sand</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> Pardon?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Ignoring him): You could not tell, and yet it looked as if<br>
 The sand was lucky in being backed by cliff <br>
 The cliff in being backed by continent</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> What are you talking about?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Forgive me - what I meant to say was THANK YOU for your expertise on my sample from the other day</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> I take it the results were to your satisfaction?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Glaring at him) Mr. Hajanian was MOST helpful</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> Glad we could be of service</line>

<stage>Anita passes by and smiles at all of them as she leaves with the cocktail waitress.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Scoffing) Lieutenant Fiore is some piece of work</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> Yes, my sister inspires that reaction in a lot of people</line>
<line><actor>Javier</actor> At least she inspires something</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'M SO SORRY, I forgot you two were related</line>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> (Still stung by her husband's comment) That's alright - KJ would you mind introducing me to your new law partner?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Sure thing</line>

<stage>The two leave.</stage>

<line><actor>Javier</actor> If you'll excuse me, Ms. McBride, I need to speak to the university president and her husband</line>

<stage>Left alone, Morrigan tries to remember the rest of the poem in her head when she spots two security guards looking at their watches at the same time and then checking another lighting sconce like the one the metal square fell out of earlier.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Something is definitely not right here!</line>

<stage>She reaches for her cell phone and remembers that all electronic devices had to be checked with security before anyone could proceed to the hall. This causes her to run out of the room with Erika noticing.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Following) What is our intrepid reporter up to now?</line>

<stage>The Lois Lane look-alike stops at the security table with long line ahead of her.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> EXCUSE ME, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I GET A PHONE, COULD SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME?</line>

<stage>Everyone ignores her except for the one, nasty comment of &quot;wait your goddamn turn, lady.&quot;</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Lowering her mask) Is there a problem, Ms. McBride</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Dr. von Meer - you wouldn't happen to have a phone, would you?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No... but there is one in Lydia's office, I'll go get the key from her</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> NO, there's no time for that - just show me where her office is and I can get in</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Fascinated) Follow me</line>

<stage>As the two hurry up the stairs, Morrigan unwittingly speaks the lines of the poem out loud.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> May I ask why you're reciting Robert Frost?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Grabbing Erika by the shoulders and almost losing her balance) YOU KNOW THAT POEM?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Yes, &quot;Once By The Pacific&quot; - why?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Her voice strained) HOW DOES IT GO, HOW DOES IT GO?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Clearing her throat)</line>
<ul>

<p>The shattered water made a misty din,<br>
 Great waves looked over others coming in,<br>
 And thought of doing something to the shore<br>
 That water never did to land before<br>
 The clouds were low and hairy in the skies<br>
 Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes.<br>
 You could not tell, and yet it looked as if<br>
 The sand was lucky in being backed by cliff,<br>
 The cliff in being backed by continent.<br>
 It looked as if a night of dark intent<br>
 Was coming, and not only a night, an age.<br>
 Someone had better be prepared for rage.<br>
 There would be more than ocean water broken<br>
 Before God's last <i>Put out the light was spoken.<br>
</p>

</ul>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Sweating) WHERE IS HER OFFICE?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> First door on the right</line>

<stage>Morrigan runs over, and with a few items from her purse, picks the lock open in seconds.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Grabbing the phone and dialing) C'mon, Gracie, ANSWER</line>

<stage>Erika stays outside the door and listens.</stage>


<stage>At the Techtonic Nightclub, Gracie is in the middle of a set when her phone vibrates.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Barely able to hear over the music) WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING ME?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> GRACIE, YOU'VE GOT TO GET ZACH AND GET OVER HERE, RIGHT NOW</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Going over to a somewhat quieter corner) Morrigan, is that you? - what's the matter, not making any new friends? - at least try to establish some potential sources</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> DAMMIT, GRACIE, LISTEN TO ME</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> WHAT'S WRONG?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I... I don't know... SOMETHING... something is very wrong here</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You're not making any sense</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Some creepy guy called earlier and read me an ominous Robert Frost poem, then I found this strange metal square and the security guards are making me very uneasy</line>

<stage>With those words, Erika bolts out of the building.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm telling you Gracie, something is going down here tonight, I'm not sure what</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Look, take a deep breath, lay off the champagne and think for a minute</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I am NOT drunk</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I'm not saying you are</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Remember my green hand dreams?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Growing concerned) Did you have another one?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> No, but it's that same feeling of dread - I can't explain it - PLEASE GET OVER HERE</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Okay, give me a few minutes to find a replacement DJ, drag Zach out of Justine's mouth and then we'll be right over</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Hanging up the phone) Thank you</line>

<stage>She returns to the hall.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Dr. von Meer, I appreciate... Dr. von Meer?</line>

<stage>Not far from the museum, Erika rips off her costume and dives into the ocean. As Darkfin, she returns to the party and is stopped by one of the guards before entering.</stage>

<line><actor>Guard</actor> And what are you supposed to be, Neptune's whore?</line>

<p><img border="0" height="252" width="207" src="../graphics/y1c13_df_face.jpg" align="right"></p>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Snapping his neck with one twist) For you, the Angel of Death</line>

<stage>After disposing of the guard's lifeless body behind some bushes, Darkfin passes through the door, checks to make sure no one else is around and then scales the wall.</stage>


<stage>Morrigan paces in the Native American section and suddenly freezes at one of the dioramas.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Looking around) I just saw a shadow move, I know I did!</line>

<stage>KJ suddenly enters the room, causing Morrigan to scream.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> HEY, HEY HEY, IT'S JUST ME</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Shaking) SHIT, KJ, I'm sorry</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Holding her) What's the matter?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Can we go back to the main room, PLEASE?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Bewildered) Sure, let's go</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Maybe Gracie's right, I think I had too much to drink</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I can take you home if you'd like?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Locking her eyes on the necklace) Shh, Lydia and the mayor are about to present the Duquesa's Tears</line>

<stage>In the eaves of the ceiling, Darkfin locks her eyes on Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> (Approaching the podium) Ladies and gentlemen, this has been such an exciting evening, I want to thank you for...</line>

<stage>All of the sudden, every light in the museum goes out, followed by a large crash and people screaming.</stage>
