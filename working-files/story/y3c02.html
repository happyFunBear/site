<stage>Swimming along the shoreline, Darkfin is too ill to make 
 it back to her lair at Concha Dos or even to her yacht at the Marina. 
 Her transmogrification is completely out of sync, causing her body even 
 more trauma.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Stumbling onto the sand) Too much... too much at one 
 time... I need to recalculate...</line>

<stage>She tries to summon her trident but is too weak to do 
 so. Aleta Oscura throws herself behind some bushes and begins to dry 
 heave.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Looking around) This is Beacon Point but I cannot... go 
 home</line>

<stage> Aware of her half-morphed and oddly colored status, 
 Darkfin struggles to think for a moment as her head spins.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> But I can go... close</line>

<stage>Outside an abandoned farmhand house on the outskirts 
 of the Fiore property, Hector Tapia and Dr. Stephanie Gates pull up 
 in a van with blackened windows. Making sure that no one is around to 
 see them, they carefully unload a stretcher containing the gravely ill 
 Karl von Meer.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Don't lose his IV!</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Lifting the stretcher down) I see it, I see it</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Packing up some equipment) Are you sure you still 
 have utilities for this place?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Only cold water from the pump but the electrical outlets should 
 be OK, if not, I can bring in a generator</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> A generator would cause too much noise</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Pushing the stretcher along) Look, Stephi, it's not like 
 you gave me a lot of time to plan this out!</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I know, I'm sorry - this was not what I had in mind 
 for my evening</line>

<stage>The two are able to roll him up to the porch and then 
 carry the stretcher up the stairs.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> What exactly happened to him?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I'm not certain but I will move heaven and earth to 
 find out</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Half smile) There's that one-track mind I know and love</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) Now is not the time for that, 
 Hector</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> See what I mean? - tunnel vision, it's very sexy</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> You know what would be sexy? - if you could get some 
 heat going in this place and spare me the double entendre</line>

<stage>Hector goes about fixing a fire in the old wood-burning 
 stove as Dr. Stephanie checks Karl's vital signs.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Taking the stethoscope out of her ears) At least his 
 blood pressure has stabilized</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Noticing the gray pallor of Karl Senior) This hombre was 
 never Mr. Fit 'n Trim but now he doesn't look good at all</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Considering the amount of poison in his system, he 
 looks remarkably well</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Shaking his head) Poison? - Christ... what kind?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I have a few theories - I'm still waiting for the lab 
 to call me back with conclusive results</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Why would someone want to poison Karl? - your asshole ex, 
 I can understand, but not Karl - he's the good kind of upper class!</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> He's still a businessman worth over $300,000,000 - 
 it's not hard to be a target with that kind of wealth</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> If this is paying the price, I'm happy being working class</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Griffin mentioned that there's some kind of major deal 
 in the works at Meeramar involving the PCOC</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Sly look) Really? - do you know what it's about?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I washed my hands of all that before the ink was dry 
 on the divorce documents but Griffin knows something, so I assume Ben, 
 Brad and Vicky are aware of it as well</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Stoking the fire in the stove) Huh</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> What has me worried is what if this deal has something 
 to do with Karl's current condition? - are my children next?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> I'm sure they'll be OK... ALL of them</line>

<stage>Stephanie casts a glare a Hector.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> Do you suspect someone in Karl's own family might have done 
 it?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Ponders for a moment) No, I can't imagine it... but 
 it might be someone close to them</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Could be... but it is pretty cruel of you to let his wife 
 and kids think he's dead</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Looking out a window) It's the only way I know of 
 right now to keep him alive</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> I still don't understand why we couldn't have kept him hidden 
 somewhere at the hospital, you have a lot of loyal people there who 
 would've kept their mouths shut</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Squeezing Karl's fingers) It's a risk I am not willing 
 to take</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Watching her hand and becoming jealous) It seems to me like 
 you're willing to risk a lot for him</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Sharply) DO YOU NOT WANT TO HELP US, HECTOR, IS THIS 
 TOO MUCH FOR YOU?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Defensive) DO YOU THINK I'D BE DOING THIS IF I DIDN'T WANT 
 TO?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I don't know, WOULD YOU? - you're always the KING OF 
 THE ANGLES - WHAT IS IN IT FOR YOU?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Folding his arms) WHAT IS IN IT FOR ME? - HOW ABOUT A RETURN 
 TRIP TO BURTEN PRISON IF I'M CAUGHT?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (On the verge of tears) JUST... JUST GIVE ME A HALF 
 HOUR TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO TAKE HIM AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
 IT ANYMORE</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Grabbing her arm) THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Snatching her arm away) WHAT DID YOU MEAN, HECTOR, 
 WHAT DID YOU MEAN?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Lowering his voice to barely above a whisper) That maybe 
 I want to do this without any angles, that maybe I want to do this for 
 you, to help you... and Karl... because I sincerely want to?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> There isn't a sincere bone in your body</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Evil grin) Yeah, there's one</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Can't help but chuckle) I suppose you're going to 
 come up with a poem about it now?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> I could try for a limerick</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I've heard enough of your limericks for one lifetime... 
 and I've also heard enough of your lies - do you actually expect me 
 to trust you now?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Of all the people to call tonight, you called ME, why?</line>

<stage>Unable to come up with an answer, the solemn woman can 
 only look down at the dusty floor.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Now standing by her side) I'll tell you why... despite all 
 of the history between us</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> A history of blackmail and deception...</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Despite ALL of that, I still love you... and I know you still 
 love me</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Holding up her hand in protest) Let's not get into 
 this NOW</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Taking her hand and holding it next to his heart) We share 
 something that goes beyond the two of us, something that validates my 
 existence no matter how flawed my existence may be</line>

<stage>Dr. Stephanie is unable to hold back the tears and the 
 two of them seek comfort in each other with an embrace.
</stage>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c02_steph-hector.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Quickly pulling back) I'm sorry... I'm overstressed</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> I can help out with that as well</line>

<stage>Before she can answer, he bends in to kiss her. At first 
 reticent, but now unable to resist, Dr. Stephanie returns it with fervor. 
 Within seconds, Hector has her pinned up against a wall next to Karl 
 Senior's bedside and begins to make love to her.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (In halting breaths) If I let you do this... are we 
 even?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Completely freezing) FUCK YOU, STEPHI - I WAS DOING YOU A 
 FAVOR - I'll go see if I can find that generator</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Fixing herself) Please do!</line>

<stage>Hector Tapia slams the door behind him. The loud noise 
 causes Karl Senior to open his eyes.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> KARL... KARL, CAN YOU HEAR ME?</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> HELP</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I'M RIGHT HERE, KARL, WE'RE HELPING YOU</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> HELP HER... HELP HER, STEPHANIE, SHE'S 
 IN DANGER</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Outside the Martel mansion on Beacon Point, Griffin is 
 on his cell phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Still no signs of Erika? - don't worry, KJ, we'll find her, 
 I promise - hold on, I have another call coming through, it might be 
 her... RIKKA, IS THAT YOU? - hello, father - no, not yet - I'm at the 
 house... no, there doesn't appear to be any major damage from the quake, 
 just some plates and glasses - DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S A WISE MOVE 
 RIGHT NOW? - FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOUR BEST FRIEND AND BUSINESS PARTNER JUST 
 DIED A FEW HOURS AGO, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? - you know the board has 
 to vote on that - no, NO - WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS AFTER I FIND ERIKA - 
 END OF DISCUSSION</line>

<stage>Griffin pitches the cell phone across the back lawn. 
 He suddenly takes notice of the boathouse in the distance.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Running towards it) Of course! 
</line>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c02_griffin.jpg" h="510" w="445"></p>

<stage>Inside the boathouse, a completely changed Erika lies 
 naked in human form amongst a pile of towels and lifejackets. She is 
 shivering and sweating as Griffin bursts through the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Going over to her side) Why didn't I think of this sooner?</line>

<stage>He gently stirs her from slumber.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Rik... Rikka, wake up</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Eyes fluttering) Griffin?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> This was always your favorite place to play hide 'n seek</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Still weak) What... what happened?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You tell me - I find you cold and naked in here and, to put 
 it mildly, you smell like rotten fish!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I took a little swim</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I can see that</line>

<stage>He suddenly turns away and becomes anxious.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Sensing his mood) What's wrong?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Swallowing hard) You haven't heard yet, have you?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Sitting up) Heard what?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I have been practicing these words in my head for the last 
 two hours...</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> WHAT, GRIFFIN, WHAT HAS HAPPENED?</line>

<stage>He turns to look her in the eye.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Utter panic) OH NO, SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO MORRIGAN</line>

<stage>Both are shocked by those words.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Um... no - this has to do with your father</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> DAD - WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO DAD?</line>

<stage>Griffin's mouth turns dry.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> GRIFFIN</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Biting his lip) He... he died, Erika</line>

<stage>Erika is thunderstruck by the news and remains motionless.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> It was a few hours ago - Pauline and KJ were there with him...</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> My mother says it was a massive heart attack, she did everything 
 she could do...</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> NO... NO NO NO - YOU'RE WRONG - ALL OF YOU</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Taking her arm) Come on, we need to get to your house</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Beating on his arm) YOU'RE WRONG, GRIFFIN - THIS IS NOT HAPPENING 
 - I WOULD HAVE FELT SOMETHING</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Holding back her arms) Rikka</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I WOULD HAVE FELT SOMETHING... I would have felt something</line>

<stage>Griffin pulls Erika into his arms as she begins to sob.</stage>

<stage>Tossing and turning on her cot in the wine cellar, Morrigan 
 McBride continues to drift in and out of consciousness as her throbbing 
 foot has finally stopped bleeding. She dreams of her childhood and a 
 day spent picnicking with her then pregnant mother, Deirdre. A six-year-old 
 Morrigan runs through the grass and deliberately falls into a puddle 
 of mud next to some wild daises. She looks up and giggles at her mother 
 who is now joined by a robed priest. The two sit on a marble bench and 
 speak as Morrigan inches closer to hear what they are saying. She tries 
 to see the priest's face but is unable to do so because of the hood 
 covering it.</stage>

<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> (Watching Morrigan) That's my little nature girl - give her 
 a field of flowers and she's content</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> As it should be</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> (Now scowling) My husband likes to joke that we should plant 
 her ankle-deep in dirt under her favorite elm out back and see if she 
 grows</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> That's an apt description</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> It's a description of a grave</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> Not necessarily</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> Please don't patronize me, father - we know she has 
 one foot in it already</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> Lower your voice, the child can hear you</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> She's a smart girl, she senses it</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> It's not Morrigan's time yet - there is a lot ahead of her, 
 first</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> (Holding her protruding stomach) I know</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Jumping up) MOMMIE, MOMMIE, WHY ARE YOUR EYES GLOWING?</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> (Quickly putting her sunglasses on) They're not glowing, 
 Honey, it's a reflection from the sun</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> PRETTY - OOH, LOOK AT THE BUGGERFLY</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> That's a beautiful butterfly, isn't it, Mo?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Chasing it) I CATCH IT FOR YOU 
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c02_mm_butterfly.jpg" h="510" w="510"></p>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> Don't hurt it, Sweetie!</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> Remember, Morrigan, we are all God's creatures</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> (Watching her daughter) I wish I never had her</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> You didn't have a choice</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> I always had a choice</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> (Firmly) No, you did not - she was meant to be - she has a 
 mission that must be fulfilled... for all of us</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> A mission she never signed up for - a mission I created for 
 her the second she was conceived - and, for that, I will never forgive 
 myself</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> It's in Fate's hands now</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> (A tear falling from her eye) I love her more than anyone 
 or anything, my own life included, how could I have done this to someone 
 I love? - how can I do this to my own daughter?</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> The moment she left your womb, there was nothing more you 
 could do to protect her - you can only try... and prepare her the best 
 you can for what lies ahead - the same you will do for your son when 
 he is born</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> How do you know it's going to be a boy?</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> I know... and so do you</line>

<stage>Deirdre sighs and leans on the priest's shoulder.</stage>

<line><actor>Priest</actor> The Marked One has already been born</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> Please don't call her that!</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> It is her birthright</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> Her name is MORRIGAN</line>
<line><actor>Priest</actor> (Looking up at the sun) You wanted some time alone with her 
 before the baby is born - I suggest you enjoy the remains of the day</line>

<stage>With that, the priest takes his leave. Morrigan watches 
 him from behind a rock and then runs over to her mother with a limp 
 and a closed fist.</stage>

<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> What happened to your foot?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I dunno, it kinda hurts</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> (Reaching) Let me see</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Stepping back) No, Mommie - look, I brought you a present</line>
<line><actor>Deirdre</actor> Really? - how thoughtful of you, what it is?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (All smiles) Something as pretty as your eyes</line>

<stage>The young girl opens her hand to reveal two torn off 
 wings of the butterfly.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Upstairs at the Quartz Lake Inn, Big Joe Tiszo deals 
 with an excruciating headache and flails about his residence.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Grabbing his head) NO, NO MORE - I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THEM ANYMORE</line>

<stage>The sound of the ringing phone finally draws his attention. 
 He fumbles with it and answers hoarsely.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> Hello? - KJ - no, I haven't been answering my phone all night 
 - I have a terrible migraine - no, I haven't seen Erika but I'll check 
 around for you... what happened? - WHAT? - NO, HOLY MOTHER OF GOD - 
 I'M SO SORRY, MY SON - I'LL BE OVER THERE AS SOON AS I CAN</line>

<stage>Hanging up the phone, Joe falls to his knees and says 
 a silent prayer.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Crossing himself and drying his tears) There's one thing I have 
 to do first...</line>

<stage>Carrying some hot cider and a bowl of vegetable soup, 
 Joe makes his way down to the wine cellar without anyone noticing. He 
 sets the meal on a box beside Morrigan and covers her with another blanket. 
 As he turns to leave, the blood-curdling shriek from the young woman 
 causes him to jump.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Springing up) MOMMIE, MOMMIE, HELP ME</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Running over to her side and comforting her) Ms. McBride... 
 Morrigan, it's alright, it was just a bad dream</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Eyes darting around) Where... where am I? - what am I doing 
 here with you?</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Amethyst brought you here - don't worry, you're safe!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> WHERE DID AMY GO? - IF THE POLICE CATCH HER...</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> She'll be fine - she has her father's instincts</line>

<stage>Morrigan looks at him for a moment.</stage>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> I brought you something to eat</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Realizing she's hungry) Thanks... I've heard good things 
 about your soup</line>

<stage>Joe smiles but continues to look troubled.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Mr. Tiszo...</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Joe, please</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Joe... I also know what you were in your past</line>

<stage>Joe becomes even more on edge.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I want you to know that I did NOT kill Father Greg, I swear 
 to you on my life - you have to believe me!</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> I do... if I didn't, I would not be providing you sanctuary</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Thank you - I'll be out of here as soon as I feel better</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> NO, you must stay here - it is not safe for you out there</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I've already placed Amy in jeopardy, I will not do the same 
 to you</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Turning red in the face) There has been enough DAMAGE out there 
 tonight, I will not risk you becoming another victim!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT? - DEAR GOD, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN 
 TO ERIKA?</line>

<stage>Both are stunned by the words.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I meant... KJ</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> No - but their father...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> WHAT HAPPENED TO KARL?</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> He... has passed on</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> HE'S DEAD?</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Yes</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> NO - HOW?</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> I'm not sure yet - I'm on my way over to the house</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Getting up) I'm going with you</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> OUT OF THE QUESTION</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Pained expression) DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, I NEED TO BE THERE 
 FOR... I JUST NEED TO BE THERE</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF THE POLICE INTRUDING 
 ON THEIR TIME OF SORROW AND LOSS?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I... suppose not</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> Stay here, stay well, and stay safe - I will return with more 
 news</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Slowly sitting back down on the cot) There has to be something 
 I can do?</line>
<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Making his way back up the stairs) You will</line>
