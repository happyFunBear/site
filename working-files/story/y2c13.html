<stage>Outside on Kylee's patio, Anita Fiore installs a new hummingbird feeder as the strawberry blonde finishes her yoga routine.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Oh, and when you're done with that, there's a leak in the bathroom sink that needs fixing</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Banging hard on the wood) You called me over here for this, not the sink</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Doing an exaggerated bend) Can't you find time for the sink as well?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Nope - I have a date tonight - I need to go</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Is it not your job to make sure the tenants' needs are satisfied?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Scoffing) IF they call and make a proper appointment</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> When would be a good time for you to fix my sink?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Rolling her eyes) I'll take a quick look at it before I leave but I'll probably have to come back and fix it tomorrow</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Fake smile) That would be fine, thank you</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Climbing down off of the ladder) So, what happened to your old hummingbird feeder?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Nonchalant) The wind knocked it down</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/y2c13_kylee_anita.jpg" h="452" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> Did this &quot;wind&quot; happen to have the name Turner?</line>

<stage>Kylee looks up at her.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> Lady, unless there was a hurricane I neglected to notice, there's no way the damage on that beam could have been done by a simple gust or two - your feeder was ripped out</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Quickly getting up) Whatever, it's none of your business</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Following) I'll make it my business if he treated you the same way!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> I appreciate the chest thumping, Fiore, but it's not necessary - it was only a little disagreement with a lot of rough sex</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Sex doesn't have to be rough, you know</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Smirking) It does if that's how you prefer it - now, please don't forget to check my sink</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Twirling her wrench) Right</line>

<stage>Before Anita reaches the bathroom, her cell phone goes off. She sighs and answers it.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> Hola... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, ONI CALM DOWN - WHAT HAPPENED?... QUICK, KYLEE, TURN ON THE NEWS</line>

<stage>The woman does so and watches the KCON report about the shooting at Saint Brendan's.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> DAMMIT, WHY WASN'T I CALLED IN FOR THIS?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Still on the phone) ARE MOM AND DAD OK? - TELL THEM I'M ON MY WAY</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> I bet he gave it to that bitch, McBride</line>

<stage>Anita is already out the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> WAIT</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIX YOUR SINK NOW, SHEPPERTON</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Slipping on some shoes and grabbing a purse) WAIT UP, I'M GOING WITH YOU</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Already down the stairs) MOVE THAT PRETTY ASS, THEN</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Erika is running down the office stairs with Griffin trailing close behind. They reach the bottom level.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Huffing and puffing) Would... you please... tell me... where you are going to... in such a hurry?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Pausing) I just remembered an important SCU meeting I had on the other side of town - it slipped my mind completely</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Why can't you call them?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Hesitant) I suppose I could... but I forgot the number</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/y2c13_erika_griffin.jpg" h="501" w="420"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Erika... what is wrong with you?</line>

<stage>She turns to face him.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> If this really is about an SCU meeting, you would never forget something like that - OR an important phone number</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> It's natural for people to forget from time to time</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes... if you're 80 and drooling - my mother thinks you might be taking drugs - are you?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, RIF</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You can tell me if you are - I'll get you any help you need - you stood by me during my little coke excursion in college, let me be here for you now</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Trying to calm herself) Griffin... really - I appreciate the sentiment, I honestly do - but you, of all people, should know me better than that - I am not a junkie - I just have a lot of things happening right now</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Flirtatious) Let me help you with those things - certainly there must be something non-scientific that I could do</line>

<stage>Erika struts over to him and searches his pant pockets.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Stunned) HERE?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Grabbing his car keys) I'll return it later</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You hate to drive - let me come with you!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> NO</line>

<stage>Griffin stares at her in silence.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Look, I need to do this alone... I'll tell you what, you know that trip to Napa you keep begging me to take?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Full smile) You'll go?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Yes... to discuss Meeramar business</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Of course</line>

<stage>Erika rushes over to Griffin's car, gets in, and zooms off.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Watching) We'll see about that</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Inside her apartment, Gracie is laying down some new techno tracks with Jeremy. She is oblivious to her pager going off with the music thumping and blaring.</stage>


<p><img src="../graphics/y2c13_gracie_jere.jpg" h="358" w="470"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Holding up headphones to one ear) THIS IS A SWEET SOUND - WHERE DID YOU GET IT?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> (Jumping around) WHAT?</line>

<stage>Gracie turns down the music a bit.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I SAID... this sound is killer - where did you come up with it?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Oh, I got it from my Dutch buddies - it's a distorted waterpipe mixed with ice-skating layered on top of a jungle beat</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> EXCELLENT</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Hey, I swung by earlier but you weren't home</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I was out with the crew watching that new lame sci-fi movie, consuming vast quantities of pizza and beer, and listening to one of McBride's horror stories</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Sounds like a decent evening</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> On paper it was</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Wasn't the movie any good?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Let's just say I enjoyed my pizza and beer and leave it at that</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> So Hal didn't go with you?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Heh, he took off to Arizona for a few days - God only knows why</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Didn't he tell you?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> No, why?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Isn't he your boyfriend?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I honestly don't know what Hal is... but he certainly is not my boyfriend</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Oh - well, don't worry, Grace - you'll find the right guy eventually!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> PLEASE, young man, don't you dare join the Cinderella chorus of &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;... unless it's remixed with a Marilyn Manson song</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Hmm, I might actually do that for Penny - but, seriously, some dude will see the true inner beauty of one Gracie Takanachi and be completely blown away</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> That &quot;inner beauty&quot; crap works well for afternoon talk shows and Hallmark stores but it sure ain't reality now is it? - the bottom line is that I'm a fat, non-white, freak with eight fingers... you try peddling that in the land of Pamela Anderson!</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Whoa - is that how you see yourself? - no wonder you attract scum like Hal! - I see a creative, intelligent, funny, super hot older lady...</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> UGH - you were doing fine until that part</line>

<stage>The two chuckle.</stage>

<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> I honestly don't see it as a problem but you do, so some friendly advice, cut back on the double bacon cheeseburgers, as for your fingers or lack of, no one can even see them at first and it's no big deal - finally, for the not being white part... if being white is so beautiful, then explain to me why thousands of women on a daily basis risk skin cancer by baking themselves on the beach or in a tanning salon?</line>

<stage>Gracie can only shrug her shoulders.</stage>

<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> What you project out there is what you're gonna get back</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You sound like my mother</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> She's right - I mean, you obviously aren't going to get the boring accountant in khakis who thinks a drink at El Torito is the highlight of his month - you wouldn't want that anyway</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Look, Little Man, I appreciate the pep talk - you're a damn good friend but things are different for a girl - just ask yours... speaking of Penny, why aren't you with her?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> I'll catch up with her later - I really wanted you to hear these samples</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> They're awesome, I'm sure I'll be able to use them 
 - OH, I talked to my brother the other day, I sent him some of your 
 sketches - he might be able to use a few designs</p>

<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> (Jumping up and down) WOOHOOOO - YOU ARE SO IT, GRACIE, THANK YOU</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Smiling) You have real talent, Kiddo, it's just a matter of trying to get bank for it in this catatonic society</line>

<stage>Suddenly, there is a loud banging on the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Looking at her watch) Jesus, do they know the time?</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> Maybe it's &quot;Mr. Right&quot; doing a late night margarita run</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> GRACIE, IT'S ZACH, OPEN UP</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Looking at Jeremy) BULLSEYE... I meant BULLSHIT</line>

<stage>Takanachi throws open the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I thought you'd still be with Justine?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (All serious) Where's your pager?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Why?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Going over to her TV) Who has your shift at KCON tonight?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Walls and Rubin, why?</line>

<stage>The scene at the church flashes across the television.</stage>

<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> TWISTED</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> That's very sad and all but I'm not Catholic and it's my night off</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> THINK, Grace - who was going over to St. B's tonight?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> HOLY FREAKING GOD, MORRIGAN</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> LET'S GO</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Almost out the door) Jere, lock up for me!</line>
<line><actor>Jeremy</actor> No problem</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Slowly cruising down the back streets away from the church for well over 15 minutes, Morrigan is in a haze, contemplating her meeting with Joenne. With Bryan Ferry's &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; filling the interior of the car, she ignores the ringing cell phone beside her.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Out loud) I wonder if I should inform my mermaid about the office temp/tap dancer/CIA operative? - I can't believe this is an actual question I just uttered!</line>

<stage>She reaches over to adjust the volume on her stereo and does not see the black Lexus barreling towards her. The other car brakes quickly and side-swipes her.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Pulling over) DAMMIT - add another to the list!</line>

<stage>McBride gets out and walks over to the other car. She is shocked to see Erika emerge from it, shaking.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> OH MY GOD, Dr. von Meer - I am so, so sorry - it's all my fault - I wasn't paying attention to the road!</line>

<stage>A silent Erika takes Morrigan's hands in hers.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> You're OK</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Perplexed) Yes, I'm fine... really</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Not letting go) Nothing has happened to you?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> No, no - I'm not hurt - I'm a little worried about you, though... you're trembling</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'm not a big fan of driving</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> And I just helped to reinforce that, sorry</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Finally letting go of her hand) Don't worry about it</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Is that your car?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No, Griffin Martel's</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> THAT'S JUST GREAT</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Don't worry, I'll handle Griffin... and I'll take care of you as well</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/y2c13_erika_morri.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Oh no, this was clearly my fault</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> You are too honest for your own good</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> So I've been told - let's call this in and get a report going so we both can be on our way</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> NO</line>

<stage>Morrigan is slightly taken aback by the forcefulness of the statement.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> There is no need to involve the police and the insurance companies - you might have been partially at fault but I was speeding, so I am just as much to blame... I'll take care of Griffin's car and I would really like to pay for some of the damage to yours</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Considering this) Hmm, actually, that sounds pretty fair - and I've had more than enough excitement for tonight... fine, thank you</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What kind of excitement?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Huh? - oh, just a fun-filled date with your brother and four others</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Well then, good night</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Wait!</line>

<stage>Morrigan goes to touch a cut above Erika's eye, causing the taller woman to recoil.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> You're bleeding and a lens in your glasses is cracked, I think you should see a doctor</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Just now realizing it) I'll be alright</line>

<stage>Erika starts to walk away.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Catching up to her) NOPE - you are not driving like that - c'mon, I'll take you to where you need to go</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> It's not necessary</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Yes, it is - I'm not taking the chance of you having another accident, especially since you can barley see now</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Knowing she's right) If you insist</line>

<stage>The two get into Morrigan's Mustang and take off.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> So, where were you going to in such a hurry?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Why were you speeding?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Um, the results of an experiment just came in and I was on my way to go read them</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Must be some experiment</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> It's important, yes</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> So, where do you need me to take you?</line>

<stage>Erika thinks for a moment as Morrigan's cell phone rings off again.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> WHO KEEPS BOTHERING ME?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Maybe if you answered it, you'd find out</line>

<stage>Morrigan glares at Erika and reluctantly picks up her phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Yeah, what do you want? - HEY, HEY, HEY GRACIE, SLOW DOWN... WHAT? - NO, THAT CAN'T BE, I WAS JUST THERE - OH MY GOD, WAS ANYONE HURT? - OH MY GOD - OK, I'LL MEET YOU THERE</line>

<stage>The car swerves into a sharp u-turn and speeds off down the road. Erika grabs on to the door handle.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Dry mouth) Sorry about that, I need to get back to Saint Brendan's</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> You're just finding out what happened there?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> YOU KNEW?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> It was on the news before I left</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I don't understand, the shooting must have happened right after I left</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Was anything strange going on there tonight?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> No, just normal church business...</line>

<stage>The thought of Joenne abruptly springs into Morrigan's mind, causing her cheeks to flush.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Noticing) What's wrong?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Nothing... I need to get to the church, shall I drop you off along the way?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> No, just keep going</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Are you sure?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Don't worry about me</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Accelerating) Thanks</line>

<stage>Within minutes, they arrive at the scene. The entire street is covered with police, news crews and on-lookers. Padre Juan is performing the last rites on the fallen priest as he is loaded into the ambulance. Anita is comforting her parents and uncle as Kylee, Zach and Gracie question those around them. Morrigan runs over as Erika observes from a distance.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> What happened?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Someone shot Father Greg</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Is he going to be OK?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> I don't think so - he was hit in the chest and the paramedics said he was unresponsive</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (On the verge of tears) This is insane, I was just here!</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> It happened right after you left</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Was it a robbery? - did anyone see what happened?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Overwhelmed) No... I... I don't think so</line>

<stage>Kylee forces her way into a live stand-up report as Gracie assists Walls and Rubin with technical duties. Lieutenant Fiore barges over to them.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> OK, IT IS TIME FOR ALL OF YOU MEDIA DOGS TO BACK THE HELL OFF AND GIVE THESE PEOPLE A MOMENT TO BREATHE - LET THE PROPER AUTHORITIES DO THEIR JOB</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Are you a &quot;proper authority,&quot; Fiore?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Fuck you, Isaacson!</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> (Sobbing) Anita, please</line>

<stage>A detective walks over to Frank to discuss a few things. The gun, sealed in a clear plastic bag, is in his possession.</stage>

<line><actor>Detective</actor> (Holding it up) Mr. Fiore, is this the weapon you found?</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> Yes, yes... that's it</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> And where exactly did you find it?</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> On the stairs right outside of the church, I pointed out where to the other officer... I picked it up without thinking, I'm sorry</line>
<line><actor>Detective</actor> That's alright, Sir, but we'll need to contact you for more information</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/y2c13_morris_gun.jpg" h="192" w="370"  b="0"></p>


<stage>Recognizing the distinctive wooden handle of the .45 revolver, Morrigan rushes over to them.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY GUN?</line>
