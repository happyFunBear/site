<h2>In the Clear</h2>

<stage>Early morning breaks over the Santa Conchita Valley. Craig and Anita 
 land their helicopter at an emergency base camp set up on the north 
 end of Chaparral Heights. Emergency crews from all over the state meet 
 with FEMA as a smoking Mount Wiggins looms in the distance.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> My legs feel like noodles right now</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Rice or egg?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Both</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> I could go for a stiff drink...</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> You're joking, right?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Maybe</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> How about settling for a bottle of aspirin instead?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Can I wash them down with gin?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Checking her watch) C'mon, cap - now is not the time to fall 
 off the wagon - I think we both need a good nap, especially if they 
 want us to pull another shift</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> You can catch a few winks during the endless meetings we have 
 ahead of us - just make sure command doesn't see you</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Two hours to tell us ten different ways to do one thing we can 
 do ourselves in five minutes</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Feds are crawling on our turf now, play nice</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Do I have to?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> At least for the next five minutes...</line>

<stage>An official from the Department of Homeland Security approaches them. 
 He's wearing sunglasses and an all-too-clean suit.</stage>

<line><actor>Official</actor> (Extending his hand) Captain Phelps, I need you to coordinate 
 with my team on the evacuation process of the east valley</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Sure thing - so far, all is going well - we've checked the major 
 roads in and out, traffic is moving along fine</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Thank God it's no longer blowing chunks the way it did last night 
 - in fact, it's almost unnatural how it just stopped all of the sudden... 
 don't you think, G-man?</line>

<stage>The official looks over his shades and eyeballs Anita.</stage>

<line><actor>Official</actor> We have a geology team from SCU giving us possible outcomes 
 - we need to plan on the worst case scenario until otherwise - is that 
 clear?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Of course</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Can you tell us what special ops was doing? - one of their jets 
 nearly caught us in a down draft</line>
<line><actor>Official</actor> (Tensing up) You must be mistaken, lieutenant, special ops 
 was no where near the event</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Yeah, they were</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Anita</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Look, I know how everything is all hush hush with you guys but 
 we nearly got taken out without warning</line>
<line><actor>Official</actor> (Now looking at Craig) Special ops was NOT involved</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> DON'T KEEP DICKING AROUND WITH US, SE&Ntilde;OR - this 
 qualifies as a national emergency and we have every right to be kept 
 informed!</line>
 
<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c11_anita.jpg" width="610" height="347"></p>

<line><actor>Official</actor> Captain, please remind your lieutenant that I have the authority 
 to reprimand her if she keeps challenging me - and, if I am not mistaken, 
 both of you have enough disciplinary actions to deal with already</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Fiore, go check the latest weather reports</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> BUT...</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Looking her in the eye) DON'T MAKE ME ASK YOU AGAIN</line>

<stage>Anita goes to say something but bites her tongue and storms off in 
 a huff.</stage>

<line><actor>Official</actor> Will she be an issue?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> No, sir... but we both know what we saw</line>
<line><actor>Official</actor> We all saw plenty of interesting things last night, captain 
 - things that do not merit public discussion</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Understood</line>
<line><actor>Official</actor> Good - now, get inside - my team is waiting for your assessment</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>In the crowded parking lot of a cheap roadside motel, Gracie sets 
 up the KCON newsvan for a live remote shoot with Kylee. A single strand 
 of black smoke can still be seen swirling above Mount Wiggins.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Checking the equipment) YES... we got a satellite uplink to 
 the station - we're on in ten!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> When are we going to get our cells back?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Not for awhile - Wiggins was THE site for large antennas - I 
 can patch you through on the uplink if you really need to call someone</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Fixing her hair) Nah, that's okay... no matter how hard I try, 
 I can't get this soot shit off of me</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Just think of it as a lively 'Bama barbecue bash</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> I'm not in the mood for your digs right now, Gracie</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Sorry</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> No, I'm sorry - I didn't get enough beauty rest last night</line>

<stage>Gracie is silent as she watches Zach at the other end of the lot, 
 just standing and staring at the mountain range.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Wow, you really are sorry - I gave you the perfect set-up and 
 you didn't even attempt a joke!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Looking at the latest wire reports) Amazingly enough, I don't 
 even find my jokes appropriate right now</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> The Quartz Lake Inn?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Cinders - the lava flow emptied into the lower end of the lake 
 but stopped there - the railroad and part of the airfield out there 
 were hit as well</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Have they come up with a death toll yet?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> 18 confirmed with over two dozen still missing - mostly hikers, 
 campers and rural inhabitants</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> That aint half bad!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Come again?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> I mean considering it looked like that thing was about to take 
 out this entire valley</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Connecting the microphone) True enough</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> It was weird how it just shut off quicker than it started up 
 - what do you suppose happened?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Who the hell knows? - California has enough natural disasters 
 without adding &quot;volcanoes&quot; to the list... if it was a natural 
 disaster</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> What do you mean?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I don't know - I thought for sure I was going to be garlic-roasted 
 Gracie last night, then I had to sleep in a dive not worthy of a derelict 
 with you, Zach, and Mirabello all taking turns farting...</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> That was NOT me - I always excuse myself</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> And now I just got word that our feed is going live nationwide 
 - you expect me to be coherent?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> OOH, NATIONWIDE? - HOW'S MY LIPSTICK?</line>

<stage>Gracie looks at a huge smudge of mascara under Kylee's eye and thinks 
 for a second.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Giving her the thumb up) Your lipstick is fine - we're good 
 to go!</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Turning serious) Gracie... was I dreaming or did you hear Zach 
 crying in the bathroom last night?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Hearing the same thing) Um, you were probably dreaming - or 
 it was the people next door... two minutes counting down</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Lemme do a quick run-through with my intro and let me know if 
 I convey enough emotion in my tone</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Tone? - are you auditioning for a part in Sigma Seven? - this 
 is a news story</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> A SAD news story but I can't appear too depressed or too chipper 
 - remember, this is going across the country</line>
<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c11_kylie.jpg" width="510" height="450"> </p>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> NO TIME NOW, WE'RE ON IN TEN... NINE... EIGHT...</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Zach is now inside the motel room. He slumps on the bed and watches 
 Kylee on the television.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> ...with residents still leaving the area, the possibility of 
 more eruptions is a fear everyone can see and feel here in the Santa 
 Conchita Valley - for KCON NewsCenter8, this is Kylee Shepperton reporting</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Muttering) Lousy tag, Kylee - Morri would have done a better 
 job...</line>

<stage>He fights back tears and vigorously rubs his face with 
 his hands. Gracie enters the room carrying two cups of coffee and a 
 bag.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Glancing at the TV) They're still running our piece?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> It's been on five channels so far</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Damn, I was hoping for an even half-dozen</line>

<stage>Zach does not respond.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> The coffee shop was a madhouse but I managed to snare you some 
 waffles</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Syrup?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Nope, sorry</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> How do you eat waffles without syrup?</line>

<stage>Gracie takes a waffle out of the bag and happily demonstrates.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Mouth full) Kylee is still there flirting with the cook - maybe 
 I could get her to score you some jam?</line>

<stage>Again, Zach barely responds.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You know, the laptop is working just fine if you wanted to write 
 up a quickie for the paper</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Staring at the wall) No thanks</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> The roads out of town are still pretty packed but we could head 
 down south</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> What's the sense?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> What?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Nevermind</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> I was talking with Justine over breakfast - she was telling 
 me more about the creepoid Father Greg and...</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I don't want to hear about it!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> But...</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I SAID, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT, GRACE</line>

<p align="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c11_zach.jpg" width="610" height="478"></p>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> WELL, MAYBE I DO - JESUS, EYES, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?</line>

<stage>Zach darts up from the bed and heads for the door. Gracie blocks his 
 exit.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Forget all the volcano stuff for a minute - I want to know exactly 
 what happened to you last night</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Not looking at her) No... you don't</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You briefly mentioned something about Amethyst and Morrigan?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> MORRI IS DEAD - OKAY? - WHEN MOUNT WIGGINS BLEW, SHE WENT RIGHT 
 ALONG WITH IT...</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> How do you know?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I WAS THERE - I HEARD HER CALL OUT TO ME - THOSE FUCKERS...</line>

<stage>Unable to hold back, Zach bangs his fist against the wall and is now 
 in tears.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> They were going to torture her, too</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> WHO?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> AMY'S PSYCHO HOOD BRIGADE</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> You're not making any...</line>

<stage>Before she can finish her sentence, Zach pushes her violently away 
 from the door. Gracie goes crashing back into the nightstand.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Knocking over a lamp) WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS?</line>

<stage>Zach ignores her and goes to leave. As he throws open the door, Kylee 
 nearly runs into him.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> JUSTINE HAS STOLEN THE NEWSVAN</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Griffin, KJ, Shelby, and Calvin all stand along the riverbank as a 
 search crew of divers and one lone sheriff's deputy complete their sweep 
 of the water.</stage>

<line><actor>Deputy</actor> We've been up and down this stretch six times, Mr. Martel - 
 there's no sign of her</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Keep searching!</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Maybe we need to expand further up stream?</line>
<line><actor>Diver</actor> That's not necessary - the flow of the river would keep the body 
 in this area or take it out to sea</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Grabbing the diver) BODY? - I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT WORD 
 AGAIN</line>

<stage>The deputy comes between them.</stage>

<line><actor>Deputy</actor> THAT is a distinct probability you are going to have to face 
 if Ms. Von Meer really did do this</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Now directing his anger at the deputy) What are you are implying?</line>
<line><actor>Deputy</actor> I'm trying to understand why she would take a header off your 
 balcony, Mr. Martel... willingly</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> DO YOU THINK I'D BE OUT HERE HALF-CRAZY LOOKING FOR HER? - 
 CALLING HER BROTHER OVER TO HELP, IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE?</line>
<line><actor>Deputy</actor> I have no idea</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I want your supervisor heading up this search - call him in, 
 NOW</line>
<line><actor>Deputy</actor> (Pointing) In case you haven't noticed the smoking mountain 
 off to you left, we're in a state of emergency right now and our resources 
 are limited</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> FINE, I'll bring in my own team since you are completely and 
 utterly USELESS</line>

<stage>KJ pulls Griffin aside and they walk away from the deputy and the 
 divers.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> We need to think about this - maybe... maybe we should check the 
 bay</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> ERIKA IS NOT DEAD</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Sniffling) I can't... I can't deal with losing my father AND my 
 sister - but why did she do this? - WHERE IS SHE, GRIFFIN?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I AM TRYING TO FIND OUT</line>

<stage>The persistent ringing of Griffin's phone stops the two.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> I thought cells were dead?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> This is my satellite phone - I need to take this</line>

<stage>Griffin steps aside for a moment as Shelby comes over to KJ.</stage>

<line><actor>Shelby</actor> I need to take Calvin home - this has been a very taxing night 
 for all of us</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I know... thanks, Shel</line>

<stage>Before she leaves, she pulls a flower out her pocket and hands it 
 to KJ.</stage>

<line><actor>Shelby</actor> Erika is alive... I can feel it</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Because your voodoo magic says so?</line>
<line><actor>Shelby</actor> It has nothing to do with my religious practices - I went to 
 Acapulco with your sister once - I watched as she shamed the local cliff 
 divers, one by one</line>

<stage>KJ perks his head up.</stage>

<line><actor>Shelby</actor> If she did dive into the river of her own accord, then she still 
 walks among us - if not, I would have felt her passing - I did not feel 
 that last night, KJ, I promise</line>
<line><actor>Calvin</actor> We felt Chango, didn't we, mommy?</line>
<line><actor>Shelby</actor> Come along, Cal, time to go</line>

<stage>With a puzzled look, KJ watches them leave as Griffin rushes over.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> We need to leave!</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> What about...</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> NOW, KJ</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Just outside of San Luis Obispo, Hector, Stephanie and Karl exit a 
 run-down truck pulled up to a remote medical clinic.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> (To the driver) Muchas gracias!</line>

<stage>Stephanie helps a robed Karl stagger up the steps to the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Hector, go inside and ask for Dr. Kaplan, we interned 
 together</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Are you sure it's safe here, Stephi?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Safer than where we were - this place is known for keeping 
 quiet - a lot of celebrity facelifts</line>

<stage>Hector hurries inside.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Hold on, Karl - we're almost there</line>
<line><actor>Karl</actor> (Weak) I don't trust him - be careful</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> I want you to rest but when you're up to it, you need 
 to explain to me what is going on</line>

<stage>An orderly with a wheelchair now approaches with Hector.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> All set - Dr. Kaplan is waiting inside</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Helping Karl in the chair) Good</line>

<stage>Hector squeezes Stephanie's shoulder and heads back to the waiting 
 truck.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Where are you going?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Home</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Why? - the eruption has stopped, I'm sure your family 
 is okay</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> I'm going back to make sure OUR family is okay</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>A private jet is on final approach to Sacramento. George sits between 
 his wife and daughter as Kylee is shown on the television screen.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Can we turn this off? - it's making me upset</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Flipping the remote) Done</line>

<stage>George comforts Lydia as Penny robotically keeps dialing her cell 
 phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> I think the people still stuck in Duquesa Bay have more reason 
 to be upset, don't you?</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Penelope, don't antagonize your mother right now</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> That was aimed more at you than her, dad - wouldn't everyone 
 like to have a private jet at their disposal when fleeing imminent danger?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Your father is part of the state government, he needs to be here 
 in order to help</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Fine, but why do we need to come along?</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Wrapping his arm around her) Maybe because I want my wife and 
 little girl close to me instead of in the path of an unpredictable volcano?</line>

<stage>Unable to resist her father's affection, Penny relents and snuggles 
 against his arm while deliberately knocking over her mother's crutch 
 with her foot.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> I just think everyone should have the same opportunities that 
 we do... that's all</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> I know you do, sweetie, you have a good heart buried underneath 
 those layers of black rags</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> She's just worried about that Jeremy heathen, that's all</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Thank you for ruining a nice moment by opening your mouth, mom</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> I'm just stating the obvious</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Glancing at George) I'm sure I'm not the only one worried about 
 my boyfriend</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Enough, ladies! - we'll be landing soon</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Grabbing her stomach) I... I don't feel so good all of the sudden</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Please don't vomit on your father's suit, he has a press conference</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Are you alright, Pen...</line>

<stage>Penny slumps down in her seat as the plane shifts drastically to the 
 side.</stage>
