<chapter-title>Myth Understanding</chapter-title>

<stage>A cherry-red Jeep speeds its way up a winding road into 
 the Don Alessandro Mountains. Inside is Tim Hajanian. A satellite phone 
 is pressed to his ear and a cigarette to his lips.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> This is an ecological nightmare on so many levels - Quartz 
 Lake is forever changed...</line>

<stage>He takes one final drag and tosses the butt out the window.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> Still no sign of Erika? - damn - this is all so crazy 
 - let me know the minute you hear something, I'll be back at SCU in 
 a few hours - okay, bye, Shelby</line>

<stage>A deep sigh is followed by the dialing of numbers.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> C'mon, Geo, pick up, pick up - FUCKING VOICE MAIL - George, 
 this is Tim, it would be oh so comforting to hear your voice right now... 
 I miss you, hope you're okay</line>

<stage>Tim throws the phone down on the seat next to him.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> Son of a bitch, I'm so tired of being there only when 
 he wants it - this has got to stop</line>

<stage>He slows his speeds and pulls off on the shoulder. The 
 view overlooks the entire Santa Conchita Valley with Mount Wiggins' 
 thin trail of smoke fading in the distance.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c12_tim_jeep.jpg" h="495" w="510"></p>
<line><actor>Tim</actor> It's time to go, it's past time to go - I'm getting the 
 bag from the cabin and hoping on the next flight to Guam</line>

<stage>Tim pulls out and drives a little further up the road. 
 He's in the process of lighting another cigarette when three Eddington 
 County sheriff vehicles block the road ahead.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Quickly extinguishing the cigarette) Shit!</line>

<stage>Three officers sporting moustaches and aviator shades 
 quickly glance at each other as Tim stops. The oldest struts over to 
 the jeep.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> Good day, officer, is there a problem?</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> Do you have business here, sir?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> My brother's cabin is five miles up the road - I needed 
 to fetch some gear</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> Can I see your license and registration, please?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Opening his wallet) Um, sure - why is this road closed 
 off if you don't mind me asking?</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> Are you unaware of the events of last night?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> Oh, I'm quite aware, officer - but we are well past the 
 volcano's radius over here</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> We don't know that for sure, now do we?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> Actually, we kinda do - see, I work at SCU and...</line>

<stage>The officer looks to his buddies and they start to come 
 over.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> Right... anyway, I'll just be five minutes, that's all, 
 I swear!</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> Sorry, no one goes past this point</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> Why is Eddington County blocking the road?</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> You sure like asking questions, don't you?</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> It's in my nature to be curious</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> Well, Mister Hag...gidgin</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> Hajanian</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> Now is not the time to be curious - the Santa Conchita 
 sheriffs are a little busy right now and we're helping out... that's 
 all you need to know</line>
<line><actor> Tim</actor> Look, I have a deputy friend at Santa Conchita - if I 
 call him up, he can vouch for me - I really need to get my gear from 
 the cabin!</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Shoving the license back at him) TURN YOUR VEHICLE 
 AROUND, SIR</line>

<stage>Tim thinks for a moment. The other two deputies take 
 a defensive posture.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> Okay, okay</line>

<stage>Tim reluctantly swings a U-turn and heads back down the 
 road.</stage>

<line><actor> Officer</actor> Have a nice day!</line>

<stage>About a mile later, out of earshot and visual range, 
 Tim takes the Jeep off road and heads back in the direction of the cabin.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> FUCK YOU, PIGS, YOU CAN SUCK MY ASS... on second thought, 
 noo</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Inside the cabin, shafts of daylight stream through the 
 holes in the window shades. Morrigan, dressed in an oversized camouflage 
 shirt, is asleep on a fold-a-way sofa in the middle of the room. Her 
 body is covered with a wool blanket and her eyes are blindfolded with 
 a red-striped necktie.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Stirring) Uhh... ow, my head - I'M BLIND, I'M BLIND</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c12_morri_bound.jpg" h="502" w="610"></p>

<stage>Wearing a black silk robe with a Japanese character embroidered 
 on the pocket, Erika steps over from the kitchen, sipping some tea.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Deepening her tone) Relax, Morrigan, you are not blind</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Trying not to panic) WHO ARE YOU? - WHY ARE MY HANDS 
 AND FEET TIED UP?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You know who this is... and why I have to keep you restrained</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Please remind me again before I SCREAM MY FREAKING 
 LUNGS OUT</line>

<stage>Erika brushes a comforting hand against the side of Morrigan's 
 cheek. The touch causes McBride to ease.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Fin? - is that you?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Yes</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You sound weird... yet familiar</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Take slow, deep breaths</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What... what happened?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Breathe, Morrigan</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I'm breathing, I'm breathing already - will you tell 
 me what's going on?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You know what happened and why this is the result</line>

<stage>Morrigan is silent for a moment trying to recall everything.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What time is it?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It is afternoon</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> AFTERNOON? - are we still at the cabin?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Yes</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I was... I was going to the bathroom and... ooh!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I told you not to come inside - you chose to ignore 
 my request and picked the lock</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Gasping) I saw...</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I had to do what was necessary to protect us both</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> A woman... a human</line>

<stage>Erika gets up and paces the room.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I... I didn't see your face, just an outline of a 
 body</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I could not allow you to see my face - I threw the shower 
 curtain over you and rendered you unconscious</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> YOU KNOCKED ME OUT?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I did what I had to do</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> OH MY GOD, HOW COULD YOU?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> How could I not? - now, if we are through with your 
 childish histrionics, maybe we can speak normally</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Are you the one that's hogtied and blindfolded taking 
 to a... a... I don't know what to call you</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Fin seems to be working rather well and I had to secure 
 you so there would be no more surprises like last night</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Okay, I'm sorry I picked the lock - could you please 
 untie me now?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I am still in an altered state - you cannot see me this 
 way</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Fine, let's make a deal - untie my arms and legs 
 and I'll keep my blindfold on</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You expect me to trust you to keep your hands from whipping 
 off the blindfold the minute I release them?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Damn, are you a lawyer?</line>

<stage>Erika goes over to the closet and searches through it.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You have a very valid point, I understand - BUT MY 
 FEET ARE KILLING ME - isn't it bad enough I had to go through this with 
 The Clergy?</line>

<stage>Erika finds a balaclava and slips it over her head. She 
 now dons fishing waders and a hooded parka.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Fin... are you there?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Trying to find boots that will fit her) Right here</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Why is your voice now muffled?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I am trying to find a solution for you</line>

<stage>Erika finishes with a pair of gloves and goes over to 
 untie Morrigan's feet and hands.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Sighing) Uh, that works... thank you</line>

<stage>Erika is deliberately standing in back of Morrigan as 
 she slowly sits up and stretches out.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I want you to know you have my word and I will not 
 remove this blindfold</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Good, because I cannot stay dressed like this for very 
 long - it is too warm, not to mention hideously unattractive</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Turning around) Can I see?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Your word?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Turning back again) Sorry</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I would simply retreat to the bathroom again and barricade 
 the door better... but we need to discuss matters</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I agree, we definitely need to talk - but I definitely 
 need to pee - lead me there?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Taking her hand) This way</line>

<stage>Erika directs Morrigan to the bathroom and closes the 
 door.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Let me know when you are finished</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Through the door) Could you please get me a glass 
 of water while I'm doing this?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Of course</line>

<stage>Erika goes into the kitchen and takes down a metal mug 
 from the cupboard. A pounding at the door startles her and the mug goes 
 clanking into the sink.</stage>

<line><actor> Officer</actor> HELLO, THIS IS THE SHERRIFF - OPEN UP</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Perfect</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> WE HEARD SOMEONE INSIDE, WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Stripping off her clothes) Um... I'LL BE RIGHT THERE</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> NOW</line>

<stage>Wearing nothing but the silk robe, Erika answers the 
 door.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Yes?</line>

<stage>One of the younger Eddington County officers from earlier 
 is standing outside. He takes in the full view of Erika before he responds.</stage>

<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Smirking) Good day, ma'am - are you the owner of 
 this residence?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Leaning in a seductive manner) No, sir - it belongs 
 to my boyfriend</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Peering inside) Is he here?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No, I am waiting for him to... come</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Leering at her breasts) I bet you are... I need to 
 see some I.D.</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Is there a problem?</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> Not at this time but we are suggesting that those 
 in this area pack up their belongings and leave</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Huh, I was under the impression that it was only a voluntary 
 evacuation?</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Brushing himself against her leg) Technically, it 
 is - but we wouldn't want a pretty thing like you to get all melted 
 if the mountain blows again</line>

<stage>Erika quickly glances back at the bathroom.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Her robe now falls open) It blew really long and hard 
 last night</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c12_erika_robe.jpg" h="409" w="500"></p>

<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Not hiding the bulge in his pants) Oh, yeah</line>

<stage>Again, Erika glances back at the bathroom.</stage>

<line><actor> Officer</actor> Is there someone else here?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No... I was getting ready for a bath when you arrived 
 - I do not want the water to spill over - get the wood floor all wet</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> I'll let you get back to that but first I need to 
 see some I.D.</line>

<stage>Erika drops her robe to the ground and slowly turns around.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> As you can see, I have nothing on me</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Now leaning against the door) I can see that</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I was so busy gathering candles and wine and lotion, 
 I forgot to bring my purse</line>

<stage>The officer's only response is heavy breathing.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> And since I have no wallet, no pockets, I am afraid 
 I have no identification</line>

<stage>Erika now presses up against him.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> But I see you have plenty of pockets</line>

<stage>Her hand slides inside one and grabs hold.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> May I pull out your badge?</line>

<stage>The officer's face is now red and sweaty as he gasps.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Working him furiously) I wish to stay at this cabin</line>
<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Getting ready to climax) I'm still... making up... 
 my mind</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Give me and my boyfriend until tomorrow... please?</line>

<stage>Another sheriff's vehicle turns up the road and honks. 
 The officer quickly backs off as his knees start to buckle. He catches 
 himself and walks stiff-legged away.</stage>

<line><actor> Officer</actor> (Wiping his face) You have until nightfall</line>

<stage>Erika shuts the door behind her and watches him leave 
 from the window. She now runs over to the sink and scrubs her hands.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Still in the bathroom) Fin?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> DO NOT COME OUT YET</line>

<stage>Erika grabs the balaclava and a blanket and disguises 
 herself the best she can. She goes over to the bathroom and opens the 
 door.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Did you bring my water?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Sighs) No... I was preoccupied</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I heard voices - they were real, voices - right?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Unfortunately so</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I stayed inside, I stayed quiet</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You did not peek outside?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I wanted to but the blindfold stayed on - I promised 
 you</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Good, thank you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Now, if there was screaming, all bets would have 
 been off</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I would hope so</line>

<stage>Erika leads her back to the sofa.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What happened?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We have to be out of here before tonight</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Just as I was getting used to this crap hole</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> But we still have enough time... to talk</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Okay</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Let me go get you your water - anything else?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> The truth, all of it!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> As much as I know</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You know plenty</line>

<stage>Erika brings the water over and takes a seat next to 
 the still blindfolded Morrigan.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> So... what's your favorite music?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Excuse me?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You are human, so you must have human likes and dislikes</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We do not have enough time to discuss my likes and dislikes 
 - we need to cover the essentials</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I think that's pretty essential in understanding 
 you better</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It is not me you need to understand - what did you learn 
 when you were with The Clergy?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> That I'm special... but not pure</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Go on</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> That I'm a living treasure map and my mom and Joe 
 Tiszo - both dead - communicate with my thoughts somehow</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Interesting</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Father Greg is... was one of them... us</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> That does not surprise me</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Oh, and that my supposed friend Amy is one of them 
 and that candle-lighting bok choi-eating landlord bitch backstabbed 
 me... and Zach - dear God, PLEASE let him be alive!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> What else?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You're not like us</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You confound The Clergy</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Good</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> And me</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> What I do not understand is why they keep me alive - 
 they could have easily killed me if they really wanted to</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I know, but you have something they want... or need</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> They have had several opportunities to take my trident</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> It goes beyond the trident - they want you... alive</line>

<stage>Erika reflects on this for a moment.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> And, so do I</line>

<stage>Erika gets up and takes a seat across the room with her 
 arms folded.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Do you remember exactly what happened before I found 
 you in the river?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> The Leader, the one in the white robe, used me to 
 find the exact location of the Nereidium - Joe sacrificed himself to 
 save me...</line>

<stage>Erika bows her head in sorrow. Morrigan falls silent 
 as tears run past the blindfold. Erika takes some tissue and stands 
 in back of Morrigan. She removes the tie from her eyes.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What are you doing?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Gently wiping Morrigan's eyes) I trust you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> About time</line>

<stage>Fully wrapped in the blanket and with the balaclava covering 
 her head, Erika takes her seat. Morrigan can't help but look but there 
 is no telling who Darkfin is.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Your turn</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> From what I have been able to gather, The Clergy are 
 a meta/super - whatever prefix you want to use - hominid that diverged 
 from our lineage and evolved on their own</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> So, they evolved faster than us?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> &quot;Faster&quot; is not the right term except for 
 a Sigma7 script - these hominids look like us and act like us but they 
 were performing organ transplants while our ancestors were inventing 
 the wheel</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Aw, I knew I should have paid better attention in 
 biology!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> There is a theory that they are tied to extra terrestrial 
 beings but I highly doubt that</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Why?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I have a hard time believing in little green men from 
 Mars</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I never believed in big green mermaids from the sea 
 either so I'm not ruling anything out</line>

<stage>Erika can't help but chortle.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> If these homonyms...</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Hominids</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Whatever - were so super, why aren't they ruling 
 the planet right now?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Who says they are not?</line>

<stage>Morrigan loses the color in her face.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> I do not know the extent of their infiltration but there 
 is only a limited number of their species - according to Sam's ancient 
 text, there was a great virus approximately 30,000 years ago that wiped 
 out over 90% of The Clergy yet all other creatures were immune - in 
 order for them to survive, they could no longer isolate themselves and 
 had to interbreed with Homo erectus... regular humans</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Guess who's coming to dinner</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> The offspring are known as &quot;Taints&quot; since 
 they are not of pure stock</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> How can any of them be pure since they had to mix 
 in?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It is a sliding scale of purity - think of alcohol in 
 beverages, 20 proof as opposed to 80 proof - their robes denote the 
 level of their purity</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> So, a brown robe is melon liqueur but the white robe 
 is straight Smirnoff?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Something like that</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Why do they call themselves The Clergy?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Humans came up with that name - although similar to 
 Latin, their language existed long before, it parallels Sanskrit - no 
 one knows for sure what they call themselves</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I do...</line>

<stage>Erika is frozen in her seat.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I heard it - from my mother, Joe... what overtook 
 me last night - I can't, I can't even pronounce it</line>

<stage>The tears reappear as Morrigan becomes flustered. Erika 
 goes over to her side and the two sit close to each other.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> It is not important right now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> The Clergy have nothing to do with human religion?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Not exactly - they have a mythos and ceremonies surrounding 
 it are similar to the world's great religions but it is based on the 
 Nereidium, not mono or polytheism - science will ultimately be their 
 downfall as well, we simply need to catch up</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You hope</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It is strictly a matter of time</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I know you've told me a little bit about this Nereidium 
 before but, forgive me, I didn't really pay attention in chemistry either 
 - what is the big deal?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It is the rarest substance on earth - it is the most 
 powerful substance on earth - even the smallest amount is highly sought 
 after</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Gasping) The clasp on the Duquesa's Tears!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Correct - that is why it was stolen, the pearls were 
 irrelevant</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> God, it seems so long ago yet like yesterday at the 
 same time</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> There are trace elements of Nereidium in Clergy blood 
 and Clergy blood only</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> So, that's how I can control your trident?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Part of the reason</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What's the rest?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Science</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I should have seen that coming</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> As part of their ritual and foretold in their writings, 
 The Clergy had to wait for the day when a &quot;Marked One&quot; would 
 arrive and pinpoint the exact location of the Nereidum vain here in 
 Duquesa Bay</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Why this place? - why me?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> The vein in the Indian Ocean is too deep and an unsuccessful 
 attempt to reach it years ago nearly ended up wrecking the biosphere</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Were you there?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Pausing) The vein off the coast of Ireland is too weak 
 and has become corrupted - why you? - I am still trying to understand 
 the specifics</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Answer my other question... were you there?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Voice cracking) Yes</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> That's how Sam died?</line>

<stage>Morrigan reaches for Erika's hand but she resists.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Sniffling) A select few in our government know about 
 The Clergy - there is a whole black ops unit devoted to keeping an eye 
 on them</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Joenne!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> They were hoping to discover the vein first and use 
 the Nereidium against them but that is moot now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Disgusted) Huh, everyone can't wait to kill each 
 other</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> The Nereidium will be used as a weapon of mass destruction, 
 but it will also be used as a tool of infinite creation to keep the 
 humans dead or under control - The Clergy will finally be able to fulfill 
 their destiny</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> At the expense of everyone and everything else?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Essentially, yes</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Okay... if they were forced to get it on with ordinary 
 folk to survive, surely they must have developed feelings for us?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You know how a farmer adores his prized pig but will 
 not hesitate to slaughter it when necessary?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Standing) I REFUSE TO BECOME BACON - WHY HASN'T 
 THE MEDIA EXPOSED THIS?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I believe you can answer that question better than I 
 can</line>

<stage>Morrigan groans and rubs her face as she plops back down 
 next to Erika.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> As much as I'd like to go back to worrying about 
 car payments and what to get for my coworker's baby shower, it's not 
 going to happen... is it?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> That seems less and less likely</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Can all of this be stopped?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Stopped? - no - altered, maybe... I actually have a 
 real issue about interfering with the natural evolution of The Clergy 
 but I also realize how powerful they are and what a detriment they would 
 be to every other living creature if not kept in line</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> All of this is so much to digest... especially on 
 an empty stomach</line>

<stage>Morrigan gets up and heads over to the kitchen.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Searching the cabinets) Cookies, I need cookies 
 - do you... can you eat cookies?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I prefer not to ingest processed foods but I technically 
 can</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Digging past a bag of beef jerky and a can of baked 
 beans) Well, you don't have much of a choice here</line>

<stage>Morrigan settles for a box of crackers and returns to 
 the sofa. She offers some to Erika but is politely refused.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> So, what about you?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> What about me?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I understand The Clergy a little better but I'm even 
 more confused about you</line>

<stage>Erika responds with silence.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I guess that means no lost underwater kingdom of 
 Atlantis to escape to or other Aleta Oscuras to come rescue us?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Damn</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Sorry to disappoint</line>

<stage>McBride focuses her gaze on the bird statue at the other 
 end of the room.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> That freaking bird is driving me nuts - where have 
 I seen it before?</line>

<stage>A sudden thump outside causes both women to jump.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Whispering) Get in the bathroom!</line>

<stage>Morrigan quickly follows instructions as Erika grabs 
 a hunting knife and scans outside the window. She spots the backside 
 of a man as he rummages through a utility shed.</stage>

<line><actor> Tim</actor> (Spotting a small black rucksack) There it is!</line>
