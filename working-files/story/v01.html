<h2>At The Movies</h2>

<stage>Sitting inside the semi-dark movie theater, Justine Mirabello and her sister, Joenne, await the new Julia Roberts movie. Joenne sits back with her feet up as Justine neatly unfolds a couple of napkins and places them on her and her sister's laps.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Watching the pre-movie ads on the screen) Why are they playing a Depeche Mode song, don't they think that would alienate the old people patrons?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Looking around the theater) We are the old people patrons!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Munching on some popcorn) I don't understand why we have to be 15 minutes early all the time?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Sipping a cherry ICEE) You want a good seat, don't you?</line>

<stage>Joenne's cell phone goes off and she quickly answers it.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Hello? - oh, hi... yeah, I'm hear with my sister - where? - what time? - great, whatever you want, Sweetie, I'll see you then... bye</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Rolling her eyes) Was that Marvin?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Don't say his name like that</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Like what? - do you want a French accent instead?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I can't stand your tone of voice when you talk about him</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> The tone of &quot;Marvin is a married slime with two young sons and you'll burn in hell for screwing him?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Sighing into her hands) Let's not start this again - why aren't you on a date with Terrance or Zach?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Terrance took me out last night - he paid, by the way, that's a concept you should study more - and Zach is off with Gracie and that crazy new girl, Morrigan</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Why is she crazy?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> She's digging into some serious shit that's probably going to land her on my slab at the morgue</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> What is it?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I can't even begin to explain it</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> WHAT, you think I'm too stupid to understand?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I didn't say you were stupid... irresponsible and childish, maybe</line>

<stage>Joenne mumbles some cuss words and shifts in her seat.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> By the way, Zach wanted me to tell you &quot;way to go at Fry's&quot; - what does that even mean?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Rubbing her head) You don't want to know</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Yes, I want to know</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> No, you don't want to know</line>

<p><img src="../graphics/v1_j_j.jpg" width="686" height="438" border="0"></p>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> Well, I REALLY want to know now - and if you don't tell me, Zach will tell me his version... is that what you want?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Fine, I met Marvin in the parking lot of Fry's and... you know, we made out</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Scrunching her face up in disgust) OH MY GOD</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> See, now you know</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> And you were right, I didn't want to know</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> One way or the other, Justi, you are going to have to deal with him being my boyfriend</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> First, it's the prison inmate, now it's a married man - what's next, a big black hermaphrodite?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Semi joking) Hmm, I always say keep my options open</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Your options or your hips?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Half smile) It was actually very cute in the car - Marvin called his ex-wife for her to talk to me... she's a shrink, you know - and she told me how he cannot find true happiness until he leaves his nasty shrew woman...</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> You mean, the mother of his children</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Annoyed) Yeah, whatever - anyway, he then had to page his current wife to tell her he'd be late for dinner, right after we started kissing</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> ENOUGH - I have heard enough!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> You don't understand, you had to be there</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Thank God I wasn't! - Jesus, Joey, you think that's CUTE? - THAT IS NOT CUTE, THAT IS INSANE</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Stop making snap judgments, Justi</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> You just told me you were making out in the parking lot of an electronics store with a married man who had you talking to his ex-wife on the phone while he paged his current one... HOW CAN I NOT?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> It's not like how it sounds</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> OH, REALLY? - and how exactly does that sound to any sensible person?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Forget it, you will never understand</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I understand perfectly - I understand he is getting off on having a virtual harem in the back seat of his mini van</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> YOU ARE CROSSING THE LINE, JUSTINE</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I... I AM CROSSING THE LINE? - I AM NOT A MISTRESS, THAT'S NOT A TITLE TO BE PROUD OF, JOENNE</line>

<stage>There is a brief moment of tense silence as Joenne angrily throws a crumpled up napkin on the ground while Justine slurps at her drink.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> I mean, Marvin is not even attractive, he looks like a washed-out hobbit</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> And you're Cindy Crawford?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> No, but I make up for it in brains - and my brain is telling me you deserve better</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Well, this &quot;hobbit&quot; brought me roses and chocolate when we met in the parking lot</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> HELLO, TACTICS - he's using the hearts and flowers to score with you... in a parking lot, no less - this is all a big game to him, who knows how many others he's doing this to at the same time!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> He's not</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Do you know that for a fact? - STD's... the gift that keeps on giving</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (On the verge of tears) You are being so GOD DAMN MEAN about this</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Do you expect me to dance with joy? - how is this different than any other time? - you laughed when I called Amy a $2.00 Street Whore for doing her married man</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> This is different, we're family!</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> EXACTLY - I shouldn't have to couch my language with you</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> There's no need to be crude or cruel</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> There is when the situation warrants it... please do not paint me as the villain here because I dare speak the obvious truth</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> You don't know what the truth is because you don't know half of what's going on</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I know the half you're telling me... a co-dependent married man with two small children who makes out with you in parking lots!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> You don't know him the way that I do</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Well, that's pretty obvious - but I DO know you... you are my sister and I love you - I don't want to see you get hurt</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Stop trying to live my life for me!</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Then, stop sounding like you're back in freaking high school - take a look in the mirror, Joey, you are no longer a teenager - I realize our childhood was royally fucked but you need to move past that and grow up!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I can't believe I'm sitting here, taking this</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Because, somewhere, deep inside, there's a tiny little voice agreeing with everything I'm saying - you're making me your confessor for a reason</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Forgive me, Justi, for I have sinned... I don't think so!</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Are you in love with him?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> NO, I AM NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM - THIS IS JUST FOR FUN</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Huh, well that's even worse because you're sacrificing your entire morality code for a few moments of slick clit nirvana - think about it with your brain... he has a reason for why his marriages don't work and PLEASE don't give me the bullshit routine of &quot;his wife doesn't understand him&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> She doesn't</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> AAARRRGGGHHH - that's the problem with everyone today, there's always an excuse to get out of everything!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> But his is true</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Sighing into her hands) Let's try looking at it from this POV... he has two young sons who will grow up thinking that a marriage vow means nothing, that it's OK to cheat on your wife because daddy did it and that women are nothing more than disposable sex toys - is that what you want?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> No, these boys will grow up to see that their father tried several times with a marriage counselor and will be happy because he is finally happy</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> And if you truly believe this, you really are too far-gone into fantasyland</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> You know, Justi, instead of looking at something with your constant, cold logic, try using emotion if you are even capable</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> OK, let's try this... if you saw me standing in the middle of the street with a Mack truck barreling right at me, would you try to save me or just stand there and smile?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Heh, don't be asking me that right now</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Softening a bit) Look, I am sorry if I'm being a little harsh but I only want what's best for you... and this is not it</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> And your relationships are so perfect?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Hardly, but I recognize the red flags much quicker now - I remember what it's like to be lonely and horny... that's what vibrators are for</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I realize you never had a problem relating to plastic but I want a live man</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> You're attacking me only because you know you don't have a real argument to validate your actions</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Actions that are making me happy in my life</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> For now... but, sooner or later, this will blow up in your face and I am trying to spare you the anguish of that - not to mention the two-hour phone calls to me whining about what a horrible mistake you made and why didn't I stop you</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Why can't you just be happy for me?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I am happy for your happiness but I cannot condone your actions - I'm sorry if I'm not being the most supportive sister in the world... but I am being the most truthful</line>

<stage>The movie is finally about to start and the popcorn box is empty.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Getting up to buy some more) Your truth, Justine, not mine</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> Whatever, Joenne... bring me back some Red Vines!</line>
