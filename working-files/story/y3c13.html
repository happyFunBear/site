<stage>A private jet makes its final approach over Sacramento. 
 The pilot struggles to regain control of the airplane as its passengers 
 are tossed around like ragdolls.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> LYDIAAAAAAAAA</line>

<stage>George is thrown across the cabin and slams up against 
 the floor as the aircraft is now upside down and drops 5,000 feet in 
 ten seconds. Lydia screams as her cane goes flying and smacks a floating 
 Penelope in the face.</stage>

<line><actor> Lydia</actor> (Screaming) OH GOD, SAVE US, SAVE US</line>

<stage>The jet veers in the opposite direction and shifts on 
 its side. George's head is bloodied from the hit.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> This... should not... be happening</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3_c13_george.jpg" h="419" w="410"></p>


<stage>The airplane momentarily steadies itself and returns 
 to a normal position.</stage>

<line><actor> Lydia</actor> GEORGE, GEORGE, HELP ME</line>

<stage>George looks to their unresponsive daughter across the 
 way.</stage>

<line><actor> Lydia</actor> GEORGE</line>

<stage>George staggers over to Lydia's side and helps her with 
 her seatbelt.</stage>

<line><actor> Lydia</actor> (Crying) Your head</line>
<line><actor> George</actor> I'm fine... Penny!</line>

<stage>The representative stumbles over debris clogging up the 
 aisle in a desperate attempt to reach his daughter. All engines suddenly 
 cease and the jet drops into another death spiral.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> (Pinned against the back wall) I... love you... Penny</line>

<stage> Lydia screams. Everything goes dark.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> (Gasping) Tim</line>

<stage>Minutes later, George squints his eyes open. He peers 
 around and realizes that the jet did not crash and that he's safely 
 on the ground.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> (Taking a deep breath) Wh... what the...</line>

<stage>Lydia's soft sobbing causes him to jump up.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> (Touching his head) Ahh</line>
<line><actor> Lydia</actor> George</line>
<line><actor> George</actor> I'm here... PENELOPE</line>

<stage>He spots his lifeless daughter on the other side of the 
 plane and races over.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> OH GOD, NO, NO - NOT HER - PLEASE, NOT HER</line>
<line><actor> Lydia</actor> George, I think I broke my leg - I... I can't walk!</line>
<line><actor> George</actor> WHEN COULD YOU EVER WALK?</line>

<stage>The fierceness of the tone stuns them both. George now 
 cradles Penelope in his arms.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> (Weeping) Please, not my little girl - TAKE ME, TAKE 
 ME INSTEAD</line>

<stage>The shaken pilot and co-pilot now appear before George.</stage>

<line><actor> Pilot</actor> Emergencies crews are on the tarmac, they'll be here 
 soon</line>
<line><actor> George</actor> (Rocking Penny) Thank you... thank you both for getting 
 us down safely</line>

<stage>The pilot and co-pilot share a look and then offer a 
 dazed shrug.</stage>

<line><actor> Pilot</actor> We didn't do a damn thing, Mr. Renselier... we have 
 no idea how this aircraft landed</line>
<line><actor> George</actor> I'm sorry?</line>
<line><actor> Co-pilot</actor> We blacked out... we all should be dead right now</line>

<stage>Penny suddenly sucks in a huge gulp of air and sits straight 
 up.</stage>

<line><actor> George</actor> (Releasing her) PENNY</line>
<line><actor> Penelope</actor> I knew we would have been better off back home</line>

<stage>The pilots back away in fear as George stares at her 
 in shock. Penelope's eyes are glowing a deep blue as she turns to Lydia.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3_c13_penny_eyes.jpg" h="406" w="460"></p>

<line><actor>Penelope</actor> Isn't that right, mother?</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Tim fetches the black rucksack and hurries back towards 
 the Jeep. Erika runs over to the bathroom door while grabbing on some 
 clothes as quick as she can.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Whispering) Morrigan, can you hear me?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Yeah, what's going on out there?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Our ride has just arrived</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Do you want me to come out?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No, not yet - carefully open the bathroom window and 
 listen for my whistle - when you hear it, go find some clothes and a 
 hat, and then get ready to leave - got it?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Okay</line>

<stage>With the utmost stealth, Erika makes her way outside 
 and sneaks up behind Tim. She flips the hunting knife around and uses 
 the heavy butt to knock him on the back of the neck. Tim instantly collapses 
 to the ground.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Taking the car keys and his sunglasses) So sorry to 
 do this to you, Timothy, but I do not have a choice</line>

<stage>She grabs under his arms and drags him back to the cabin 
 porch. She quickly takes off his clothes and leaves him on the swing 
 in the black silk robe.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> I must say, you could not have come at a better time</line>

<stage>She checks his vitals and his eyes to make sure she didn't 
 hit him too hard.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Do not worry, I will take good care of your Jeep and 
 I will make all of this up to you... I promise</line>

<stage>She covers him with the blanket so Morrigan can't see. 
 Erika now puts the parka back on and whistles.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I heard that!</line>

<stage>Morrigan darts out of the bathroom, gets dressed, grabs 
 a box of crackers and some water for the road, and runs outside.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3_c13_erika_morrigan.jpg" h="494" w="410"></p>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Noticing the lump under the blanket) Who is that?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Deepening her voice) Nevermind, get in the back of 
 the Jeep and crouch down as much as possible</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> YOU DIDN'T KILL AGAIN, DID YOU?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> NO, now go!</line>

<stage>Morrigan runs over to the Jeep and climbs inside. Erika 
 quickly checks around and follows behind.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Starting the engine) We are most fortunate to have 
 a way out of here - unfortunately, this vehicle has no cover</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Beggars can't be choosers</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We will appear odd with our clothing and I cannot take 
 the chance of anyone identifying you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Look, I'm crouching down as much as I can with this 
 stupid bulky bag in the way</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Flooring it) Find a way to compensate - hang tight, 
 we need to go off-road because of our earlier visitor</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Preparing to dump Tim's bag) Slow down for a sec 
 so I can toss this thing...HOLY HELL</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Slamming on the breaks) What?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Holding the bag open) Lookie what's inside!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Stunned) My my, I wonder what he was doing with this?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Who?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Unless it belongs to his brother, Geoff</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> WHO IS GEOFF?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Nevermind - do not dump this, it might come in handy 
 for us later on</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Um, handy if we want even MORE trouble</line>

<stage>Erika spots one of the sheriff's cars on the upper road.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Killing the engine) Speaking of which...</line>

<stage>The two remain still as the it passes.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> Once the pests leave, it will be a straight shot along 
 the riverbank - everyone is too preoccupied with the volcano to notice 
 us</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Hope you're right</line>

<stage>They start up again and travel on. Morrigan spots the 
 phone in the front seat.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Hey, that's a satellite phone</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> So it is</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Reaching for it) I want to make one quick call...</line>

<stage>Erika snatches the phone away.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> NO</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> WHY?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We cannot have anyone knowing that you are still in 
 town</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> What about still alive? - a lot of people think I'm 
 dead</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Even better</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> My dad...</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Thinking of her own) I know... but it is not safe for 
 you yet - give it more time</line>

<stage>Morrigan sighs and rubs her eyes.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Fine... so, where are we going? - the undersea Bat 
 Cave?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Up north?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Home</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Home? - I thought you said we weren't going to your 
 place?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I am taking you home, your home on Willowbrook</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> HAVE YOU BEEN OUT OF THE WATER TOO LONG?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> The city has been evacuated, no one will suspect that 
 you have returned</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> YOU HAVE COMPLETELY LOST IT, FIN - NO FUCKING WAY</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Keep the shades drawn and try not to make too much noise</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> HELLO, ONE NAME FOR YOU, AMETHYST</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> She should not be an issue</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> SHE TRIED TO FUCKING KILL ME</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Please stop using that particular obscenity</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Well, what do you want me to say except NOOOOOOOOOO</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You have heard the words 'keep your friends close and 
 your enemies closer'</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Pardon me for not wanting to share zucchini bread 
 with someone who willingly offered me up to her crew of loonies!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> If Amethyst wanted you dead, she would have killed you 
 long ago</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Thinking) Well, she did try to save Zach... Tallulah 
 always liked Amy and... NO NO NO, NOOOOO</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Do not fear her for you are vastly more powerful than 
 she is - The Clergy knows this and she will not go after you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Ya think? - 'cause I'm thinking my duplicitous landlord 
 will invite her hood pals over for a backyard blowout starring me as 
 the pale-faced pi&ntilde;ata!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You actually have more color in your cheeks since the 
 incident</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> WHY CAN'T I COME WITH YOU TO THE CAVE?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You need to stay on land... and you need a link to The 
 Clergy, Amethyst is that link - find a way to use her as she has used 
 you</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Sighing) I just don't think I'm going to be very 
 safe</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You will</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> And you know this... HOW?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Instinct tells me so</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Oh well, I totally feel reassured now</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I will check up on you frequently</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I think you need to do more than check up on me</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Such as?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You could, you know, maybe bring chocolate? - helps 
 the nerves</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We shall see</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Will you be back to your green self soon?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Hopefully</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Will I ever get to see the real you again?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Hopefully not</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Later that afternoon, Zach sits along on the beach and 
 watches the incoming waves. Gracie makes her way towards him and deliberately 
 keeps her distance.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I finally got a hold of Turner and told him the newsvan 
 was swiped - I didn't tell him it was Justine because I'm hoping she 
 ditched it by now</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I'm hoping she found Joenne</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Kylee is getting a ride from the cook... and he's driving 
 her home later</line>

<stage>The joke does not tempt Zach.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Ooookaaay</line>

<stage>Gracie sits down on the sand near him but still at arm's 
 length.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Just to be clear, are we going to talk about what happened 
 earlier or are we going to pretend that it didn't happen?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I'm leaning towards the latter</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> The huge bruise on my ass begs to differ</line>

<stage>This causes Isaacson to cackle like a hyena and bury 
 his face in his hands.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I'm glad you think shoving your friend into furniture... 
 cheap, hideous furniture is funny</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> It's not funny... it's payback</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> EXCUSE ME?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Not for you, for me</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Shaking her head) I am really lingering in a WTF fog 
 right now - you need to clarify</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Gillian Reuther</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Gillian Who Her?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Ruether... my first real girlfriend</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Again with the fog, but this time, there's a cold breeze 
 blowing with it</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> What happened to me was payback for the way I treated 
 Gillian Ruether and every other mean, nasty, deceitful, dishonest, obnoxious, 
 wrong thing I have ever done in my life</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> What have you been smoking, besides the soot in the 
 air? - I'm going to let you ramble on and, hopefully, I can piece it 
 together after another cup of coffee</line>

<stage>Zach gets up and starts walking along the shore. Gracie 
 reluctantly trails behind.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> Back in high school, I wasn't rich, good looking, or 
 a jock...</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> No shit?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Because of that, there was a limited dating pool for 
 me to choose from and getting laid was the only real objective</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Mine was to sleep through my classes without getting 
 detention</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Grace - can I focus on my story please?</line>

<stage>Gracie motions for him to go on.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> Gillian... Gill was the lead clarinet player in the band 
 - I played trombone...</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Trom BONE... heh heh heh, sorry</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> She was smart and kind but was also this huge, frumpy 
 cow</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Well, you know, we all can't look like Princess Fucking 
 Barbie!</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I know... well, I know now - anyway, no one really wanted 
 to hang out with her - on her band jacket, the &quot;G&quot; wore off 
 for some reason and she walked around with &quot;ill&quot; over her 
 pocket</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> COOL</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> NOT COOL, why the hell didn't she fix it?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Maybe she didn't think it needed fixing?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Whatever - it was now my senior year and I had yet to, 
 you know, fuck someone besides myself and half a watermelon</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> EWW</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> IT WAS HOT</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> You have just ruined Midori for me forever</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I knew I had to get some action before the other guys 
 got on my case - we had a bunch of classes together and she was always 
 trying to talk to me - one day, I decided to talk back</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> How oh so very magnanimous of you</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> My older cousin told me that if I took her out for pizza, 
 she'd probably give it up</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> All you guys are such pigs... but it totally worked, 
 didn't it?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Like a charm - who knew anchovies were such an aphrodisiac?</line>

<stage>Gracie raises her hand and winks.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> It was her first time as well - that was a bigger score 
 for me than my Pac-Man high</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Ooh</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> But I didn't give a shit about Gill... I said what I 
 needed to say to get me some action and to brag to the other guys about 
 cherry popping - meanwhile, she's making me homemade Valentines and 
 buying me clothes and meals - all the things I thought I was supposed 
 to do for a girlfriend... was she really that desperate?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Growling) Maybe she was just trying to be nice, asshole</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> We went together for almost a year - she would always 
 have these bridal magazines with the pages highlighted and she talked 
 about getting a Golden Retriever</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> She already had one dog, guess she wanted a smarter 
 one</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> (Ignoring the dig) I was totally like 'yeah, yeah, whatever 
 makes you happy, babe, now suck my dick'... and she'd swallow, too</line>

<stage>Gracie goes to say something but bites her lip.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> By the time I got to college and filled out more, all 
 of the sudden, there were these horny gorgeous girls who would get drunk 
 and do any guy with a pulse!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Yep, I remember those days... vaguely</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I actually had a girl who was a Miss Hawaiian Tropic 
 contestant - can you believe that?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Huh, she must've been really wasted</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> One weekend, Gill surprised me with a visit and saw me 
 with this girl - I was like &quot;Gill who?&quot;</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Um, yes, that was a sleazy lowball thing to do but 
 I'm still waiting for the strangling kittens part - seriously, Zach, 
 why are you beating yourself up over this now?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I haven't finished...</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Go on, go on</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I took glee in verbally assaulting her - she was a huge 
 reminder of what I was before and I was pissed beyond belief that she 
 dare show up in my new life, in front of my new girl, with her hokey 
 homemade cupcakes and her pathetic I LUV U teddy bear - and I told her 
 so</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Okay, the heartless dirtbag part is starting to shine 
 now</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I screamed so everyone in earshot could hear what an 
 ugly, hairy, walrus she was - I told her that I was just using her for 
 sex and it wasn't even good sex - and, unless she did a complete body 
 transplant, no one would ever love her no matter how many stupid Valentines 
 she made!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Wiping a tear) You win, Eyes... you are indeed one 
 world class piece of sleaze!</line>

<stage>Zach sinks back down to the sand and sighs.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> Still not done</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> GOOD GOD - what else?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Gill... went back home and hung herself</line>

<stage>Gracie recoils and dry heaves.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> That's the ultimate power, isn't it? - the power to talk 
 someone else into committing suicide?</line>

<stage>Gracie can't hold back the sobs.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> I'm worse than fucking Hitler... and all because I couldn't 
 accept Gill for who she really was - yes, I am that horrifically shallow 
 - all those feel-good lines about loving someone for who they are, not 
 what they look like... sorry, it's bullshit to me</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Wiping her nose) You... SO need to stop talking</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> It's like... it's like finally having Kylee but then 
 having to settle for you</line>

<stage>Unable to contain herself, Gracie swings around and wallops 
 Zach on the side of the head.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> YOU SON OF A BITCH</line>

<stage>Zach slumps in the sand and whimpers.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> Gracie</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Walking away) I CAN'T BE AROUND YOU ANYMORE</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> GRACIE</line>

<stage>Gracie reaches in her pocket and hurls some change right 
 at Zach's face.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Call someone to come get you, Isaacson, because I don't 
 ever EVER want to see you again!</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I WAS RAPED</line>

<stage>Gracie freezes in her tracks.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> I was gang raped</line> 
<bar></bar>
