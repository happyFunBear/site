<stage>Inside his Meeramar office, which has been retrofitted with extra security measures, Griffin Martel speaks on his private phone to Erika.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> How are you doing this morning?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I can see clearly... out of one eye</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Do you want me to come over?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'm fine, Rif, really - look, I am truly sorry about the accident, I'll have my father stop by the dealership and pick you out a new car later</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> That's really not necessary</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Yes, it is</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Rikka, I own the dealership</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Ah... right</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I can pick it out myself - what I'm more interested in is why you didn't report the accident to the police when it happened?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I thought KJ explained it to you last night? - it was mostly my fault, I didn't want the insurance company hassle</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes, but now we have the complication of Morrigan McBride - have you seen the papers today?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> She did not shoot that priest</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> They're investigating her as the main suspect</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> She's being set up</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> How do you know?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> It's just a feeling I have</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> How very scientific of you</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I working on the postulate this very moment</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Once again, KJ's superlative dating selection is bringing a stench to the family - Morrigan has been nothing but a Samuel Beckett wet dream since she arrived in Duquesa Bay - stay away from her</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Any other orders, Sire?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Are you coming into the office today? - there is an exciting new development that I want to discuss with you... in person</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Listen, we're still on for that weekend in Napa but I just can't be bothered today - I have too many tests going at the lab</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Growing angry) Have Shelby do them</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> She has her own to do</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Shouting) YOU FUCKED UP MY CAR, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR THE BUSINESS... AND TO ME</line>

<stage>There is a short silence on the phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> You're about to have a meeting with your father, aren't you?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes, why?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'll see what I can do later this afternoon</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> We could have lunch</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Clicking off) Goodbye, Griffin</line>

<stage>The middle Martel brother snaps his phone off and sighs. His large Samoan assistant knocks on the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You may only enter if you bear good news</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> (Carrying a large wooden box and smiling) I believe it is, Sir</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Standing up) Is that what I think it is?</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> (Setting it on the table) It just arrived by special messenger</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Eagerly opening it) Excellent!</line>

<stage>The two stare at the industrial-sized drill bit sitting in a velvet-lined compartment.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Picking it up) I can't believe how light this is</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> The prototypes were most successful - not the exact same composition as what we're searching for but close enough to be of great assistance</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Looking at his watch) The timing couldn't have been better</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> They have been mass-produced and the shipment is expected to arrive in a week's time</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Huh, we'll actually be ahead of schedule for once</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> They sent you this first one as a special gift</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I suppose we should give it an official designation</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> Actually, Sir, they already have - the DM5</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Thinking for a minute) You've got to be kidding me</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> It's the fifth and final version since this project began</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Gritting his teeth) &quot;DM?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> (Looking away) Um... they named it after your father</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Putting it back in the box) Of course... I want this stored in my private vault, even with all of the new security measures, I do not feel comfortable keeping it here</line>
<line><actor>Assistant</actor> Shall I do it now?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Slamming it shut) In a few hours, I might as well show it to the man whose initials it bears</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>At the Duquesa Bay Yacht &amp; Polo Club, Douglas is preparing his horse for a practice match with a few business associates.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Putting out a cigar) I'm telling you, Collins, this new first baseman we just signed is pure money - he can barely speak English but who the hell can these days?

<stage>The group of men chuckle as a call from Griffin rings through to Doug on his cell.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Sighing and answering it) What's the problem now, son?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> No problem, father - in fact, I think you're going to be please with what I have...
<line><actor>Doug</actor> This will have to wait until I get back to the office, I'm busy
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> But
<line><actor>Doug</actor> I'll see you in a couple of hours

<stage>The Martel patriarch stuffs the phone in his gear bag and shakes his head.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> Christ, you would think that with four sons at least ONE of them would have my backbone
<line><actor>Collins</actor> What about your daughter?
<line><actor>Doug</actor> What about her?

<stage>Collins blinks.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> Oh, well Vikki is quite capable... for a girl - but she has her place on the bench
<line><actor>Collins</actor> Heh, true - we are going to need her shortly - but I do think that Griffin is doing a good enough job
<line><actor>Doug</actor> &quot;Good enough&quot; does not cut it in my book - he has a lot more to learn - now, Bradley has the balls but he's too busy thinking with them right now
<line><actor>Collins</actor> There's no hope for Ben?
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Scowling) No - the last shred was snuffed out when he married KCON's queen dom and became &quot;Mr. Claudia Steel&quot;
<line><actor>Collins</actor> (Shrugging) Well, there's always baby Ivan
<line><actor>Doug</actor> Nah, I can tell already that he's going to be high maintenance like his mother - just by the way he craps his diapers
<line><actor>Collins</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) That's a unique paradigm

<stage>Doug suddenly notices a man loitering at the far end of the field.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Recognizing him) Um, gentlemen, you all go on ahead 
 - there's a matter I need to take care of real quick

<stage>He saunters over to the man with large ears and the 
 two take a walk over to a secluded area.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> You must have something for me to show up here
<line><actor>Man</actor> Sure do, Mr. M - I'm not sure you're gonna like it much
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Squinting) I doubt I'll like it at all - hand it over

<stage>The man gives him a small video camera with a playback monitor.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Getting frustrated with the buttons) How do you work this asinine thing?
<line><actor>Man</actor> Uh... here, allow me

<stage>The man switches on the player and Doug watches images of Ursula, wearing nothing but Captain Phelps' unbuttoned uniform shirt, sitting astride a naked Craig, flash by. After a moment, he silently places the viewer on top of a small slate wall and takes his mallet to it.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Smashing it to bits) HOW DARE YOU - I SAVED YOU - I MADE YOU - YOU ARE THE MOTHER OF MY SON

<p><img src="../graphics/y2c16_doug.jpg" h="435" w="470"  b="0"></p>


<stage>He pauses to catch his breath.</stage>

<line><actor>Man</actor> They'll be meeting at his place later - so... do you want me to fix this little problem?
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Walking through the pieces of the player) NO - there are some matters a man needs to handle himself
<line><actor>Man</actor> Right - about my fee?

<stage>Douglas whips around with the mallet still in his hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Man</actor> (Backing off) Ooh, you know, just... uh, just send it on in to the office - and if there's anything else I can help with
<line><actor>Doug</actor> Get lost... NOW

<stage>The man does as he is told while Martel returns to his associates.</stage>

<line><actor>Collins</actor> Everything alright?
<line><actor>Doug</actor> Yes - perfect - but I need to take care of some business, please go on without me
<bar></bar>

<stage>As Griffin prepares to go before a hastily called meeting of the Pacific Coast Oil Cartel, Erika shows up at his office.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (All smiles) You decided to take me up on my lunch offer?

<stage>Erika tosses him a sack containing two salads to go.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Taking a seat) Let's get down to business - what was so important that you guilt tripped me into coming over?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Gesturing to the box) I have something inside here that's going to floor you
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Adjusting her extra pair of glasses) Not another &quot;dildo in the magic box&quot; gag
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Evil grin) I nearly killed Sister Marie Sabine with that in Ghent
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Are we here to reminisce?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Actually, what's in this box will astonish even you, dear - I'm getting ready to present it to the board but I wanted you to see it first... actually, I wanted my father to see it first but he's not here
<line><actor>Erika</actor> And I am... lucky me

<stage>Griffin opens the box with a flourish and takes out the drill bit.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> That actually looks painful
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> It goes on the end of an industrial drill
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Unimpressed) Was there a sale at SEARS?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> The DM5 is the state-of-the-art tool we'll be using for our next project
<line><actor>Erika</actor> DM5?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Just some silly title designation - here, you're the scientist, have a look!

<stage>He presents it to a suddenly piqued Erika who can't help but notice how similar it is to Nereidium.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> This... this metal is so light - what is it?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> It's some kind of alloy our R&amp;D team came up with - it's not exactly what we were hoping for but it should get the job done
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Why do I have the feeling that you're going to be drilling for more than oil?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Hesitant) Well... yes, I guess you could assume that
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What is it?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I can't really say at the moment except that the metal we're going after will make this drill bit seem like talcum powder compared to pure cocaine
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Trying to remain cool) That's a pretty boastful claim - as a scientist, I am extremely skeptical until there have been numerous studies to back up those words
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Believe me, once we tap this vein, there will be no need for studies - this is a natural resource that will revolutionize the world with its industrial applications
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Don't you mean military?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Taking the bit and putting it back inside the box) The military IS an industry, Erika

<stage>The von Meer daughter studies a beaming Griffin.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> IF all goes according to plan - one thing I have learned over the course of my experiments is that you can never predict unknown variables
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> There will be no unknown variables - if there are, we'll simply eliminate them... in fact, one is already out of the way

<stage>Before she can respond, Douglas barges in.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> OK, what's so important, Griffin?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I was just showing Erika and now I'm about to show it to the PCOC board
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Going right over to the box) Is this what we've been waiting for?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes... the DM5
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Throwing open the box and checking out the bit) Huh, they named it after me, that's the least they could do with all the money I've spent on this venture
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Sour expression) We could send it back and wait for your image to be engraved on it?

<stage>Erika turns aside to stifle a laugh.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> Is everyone gathered?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes, they're waiting in Conference Room 4
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Gingerly putting it back in the box) Fine, give me your notes and let's go
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Notes? - but I'm giving the presentation
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Heading out the door) Not anymore - come on, get a move on, I have to be somewhere shortly
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Looking at Erika and then to his father) WHY DON'T YOU GO THERE NOW? - I HAVE THIS UNDER CONTROL
<line><actor>Doug</actor> I'm sure you do, son, but this is much too important for you to screw up in the slightest way
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Douglas, why don't you let Griffin give the presentation? - if I remember correctly, the last presentation YOU gave resulted in half of the room falling asleep while the remainder either cracked jokes or picked their noses?
<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Cocky smile) Is this the official von Meer family stance, Erika - since I don't see your father or brother participating in this?
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Strutting past him and out of the room) They have better things to do... as do I

<stage>The two Martel men watch as she slams the door behind her.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> Jesus, boy, you let a woman fight your battles for you?
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Am I giving the presentation or not?
<line><actor>Doug</actor> C'mon - we'll both do it
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Huffing) Fine

<stage>As he starts to walk off, his father grabs his shoulder.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Nodding back to the box) Aren't you forgetting something?

<stage>Griffin glares at his father, grabs up the box, and rushes out. Doug now receives a call on his cell from Ursula.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> (Gritting his teeth) Hello, Legs - yes, I'm on my way to a meeting - it looks like I'll be busy all night... right... love you too
<bar></bar>

<stage>Outside on his condo patio, Captain Phelps barbecues some steaks while a naked Ursula relaxes in the hot tub.</stage>


<p><img src="../graphics/y2c16_craig.jpg" h="457" w="520"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> You know, we've been seeing each other for weeks now and I have no idea how you like your meat cooked?</line>
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (Finishing a margarita) Craigy, we are just having sex, please don't turn it into anything more than that
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Um, so do I take that as a &quot;well done?&quot;
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> As long as you serve it with mushrooms, I will be happy

<stage>Craig thinks for a moment and then dashes into the kitchen where he quickly picks some mushroom slices off of a pizza in the fridge.</stage>

<line><actor>Ursula</actor> Back in Montenegro, my Papa grew the best mushrooms, they were the pride of our village - last week at this Sigma 7 charity event, we had to chase these shiny bald cancer kids around giant paper mache day-glo colored mushrooms - haven't these poor children suffered enough I thought?
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Returning to the patio) I'm sorry, I missed what you said
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> How fortunate for you - really - I love it here, it's so humble and peaceful
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Opening himself a Diet Coke) Thanks... I think - actually, it won't be very peaceful starting next weekend, I'll have my daughter for a whole month while the ex goes off on some new age spiritual retreat
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> This better not interfere with our rendezvous
<line><actor>Craig</actor> We'll figure it out but I do want you to meet my little girl
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (Sighing) I already have one child I've pawned off on nannies, what's one more?
<line><actor>Craig</actor> She's a big fan of your show
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> I am NOT wearing the R'xal costume
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Flipping over the steaks) Don't worry, &quot;Bogree&quot; is her favorite
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> WHAT?
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Only because she watches &quot;Life's Little Lessons&quot; all the time on The Rerun Network
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (Grimacing) Marcy... MARCY, MARCY, MARCY - heh, maybe if I had anglicized MY name, the public would be more adoring
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Marcy Nolan is not her real name?
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> Try &quot;Marta Noliakas&quot;... and she has to have her moustache waxed once a month
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Ooh, I wonder if Fiore is aware of that?
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> Who is Fiore?
<line><actor>Craig</actor> My lieutenant - a new suitor of your co-star
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> Tell him not to waste his time, she has a finace
<line><actor>Craig</actor> You have a husband
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> I see, it's OK for him to screw around but not me?
<line><actor>Craig</actor> That's not the point - and, besides... it's not &quot;he&quot; - it's &quot;she&quot;... Anita Fiore
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (Jumping out of the tub) Is this true?
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Finishing up the dinner) It's all I hear out of her mouth besides Dark... er, work
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (Hugging Craig) Wonderful - I have some new leverage now
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Like your husband being the executive producer isn't enough of an 800 lb. gorilla?
<line><actor>Ursula</actor> (Now kissing Craig) Gorilla... how apt... make love to me
<line><actor>Craig</actor> But the steaks are done?

<stage>Ursula pushes the plates aside and the two stumble back into the hot tub. A loud thump is heard from the other side of the wall as Doug comes crashing through the bushes with his mallet in hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Doug</actor> YOU'RE GONNA BE DONE NEXT, PHELPS - AND THIS TIME, NOT BY MY WIFE</line>
