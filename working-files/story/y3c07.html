<h2>Divining</h2>

<stage>Speeding along in the KCON newsvan, an exhausted and 
 still baffled Gracie heads back to the station from the von Meer estate. 
 Kylee finishes up some notes from their last report.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Unbelievable</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> (Opening up some gum) Karl Sr. was on the young side 
 of old but he was still old - back in Alabama, they drop like flies 
 at his age
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c07_gracie-kylee.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> That's because two-thirds of their bodies are made up 
 of lard and tobacco</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Occasionally, we'll have the one that lives to 112 but 
 that's always on the side of the family we can't stand - I remember 
 this great uncle...</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Let me stop you here - my original, guttural remark 
 of &quot;unbelievable&quot; was meant to be a general, throw-away comment 
 that was nothing more than an observation of this day's complete insanity... 
 not a set-up for sharing Shepperton family incest moments</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Would you like a piece of Dentyne?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Sighing and taking the gum) Thanks</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> No, thank you - especially the way you slurped up those 
 little onion quiches</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Gritting her teeth) I didn't have any lunch</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I wonder what makes people think the way they do? - 
 my husband just died, maybe I should put out some onion quiche?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I highly doubt Mrs. von Meer was the one doing the 
 cooking - they have, what, a dozen servants or something?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> That's true</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I feel really bad for KJ, I've never seen him so devastated 
 - and I feel like crap for intruding on his family's privacy</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> He should be glad that we were assigned this story, 
 we were very respectful of all the von Meers</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Good God, I actually agree with you - what is going 
 on today?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> It's just too bad Erika is such a disappointment</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Huh?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> It's not right that she's not married with kids by now 
 - poor Karl went to his grave without being a granddaddy - that's a 
 sin where I come from!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Remind me to never go there</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I'm serious</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Um, we're around the same age and neither one of us 
 is married with offspring?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Don't remind me... at least I'm trying to do something 
 about it - thankfully, my step-sister just gave birth to her fourth 
 so the pressure is off of me for now</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> How come you're singling out Erika? - why not KJ?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Because, it's more acceptable for him to be a playboy 
 bachelor with his money and looks - but for Erika, with her breeding 
 and beauty, she doesn't have to struggle in a thankless job like we 
 do</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I kinda like my career</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> That is not the point - the point is she should be married 
 to Griffin, having his children, keeping the family business and the 
 bloodlines growing - not playing around with sea urchins</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Did Martel give you that sound bite while you were 
 giving him head in the bathroom?</line>

<stage>Kylee remains silent and snaps her gum.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Uh-huh... so, Erika can't play with fish but it's okay 
 for guys like KJ and Griffin to play around with bunnies?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> What?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I don't know... I'm tired and confused</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I know KJ is sweet on our little outlaw McBride but 
 I have no doubt with all the ladies in his past that there's an illegitimate 
 nest in his tree somewhere</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> You know, I have enough problems with my own personal 
 life, I don't even want to venture a guess with his</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Ooh, someone sounds like she needs to talk!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Oh God, why did I speak to her, why, why?</line>

<stage>Gracie sticks out her tongue.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Here, take your gum back</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Okay then, nevermind, I was just trying to be friendly</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Ugh... I really need to talk to someone about this 
 - why does it have to be you?</line>

<stage>Kylee rolls down the van window and screams across traffic 
 to a man in a convertible.</stage>

<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Hello there, my camerawoman-slash-segment producer can't 
 talk to me about something - it's most likely something sexual - do 
 you think you could talk to her instead?</line>

<stage>A mortified Gracie punches the gas and they zoom down 
 the road.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> This day has to end, this day has to end soon</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Not for us, we have another assignment for 11:00</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> We just have to do a quick follow-up on the quake - 
 I figure we'll get a shot of you straddling the huge new crack in the 
 valley floor</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Why not get a shot of me in front of some damaged buildings?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Everyone is doing damaged building shots - besides, 
 people love to see you straddle, ratings go up</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> But it's dark outside?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> You forget, you are in the presence of the Queen of 
 Lighting - how do you think I get your damaged hair to look so soft?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> That's right, I'm with Takanachi the frustrated artiste 
 - Good Lord, Gracie, it's a two-minute package featuring dirt!</line>

<stage>Gracie slams on the brakes and does a quick u-turn.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Fine, we'll do a damaged building shot, let's get this 
 over with</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> WAIT... I'm sorry - let's do the crack, I wanna do the 
 crack with you!</line>

<stage>Gracie bursts into uncontrollable giggles. Kylee can't 
 help but join in.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Wiping the tears from her eyes) Oh, I so need that 
 - that was funny for no real reason - so we're sticking to the original 
 plan?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Yes, take as long as you need... I'm not too keen on 
 rushing home</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Christ, we're back to the girl talk again... what's 
 wrong at home?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I just don't want to go - Turner has been acting strange 
 lately</line>

<stage>Gracie gives her a look.</stage>

<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Even more so than usual - he's been disappearing in 
 the middle of the night</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Um, he does have a wife and kids</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> They mean nothing to him... I dunno, these last few 
 days especially, it's as if something is in the air</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Start singing Phil Collins and I'll smack you</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I'm glad work has been keeping me busy</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Nothing beats the misfortune of others to distract 
 us from our own</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I just don't want to go home tonight - is that so wrong?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> No... I know the feeling, believe me - if you want, 
 we can split a room at the Holiday Inn</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Eww, I was thinking more along the lines of the Del 
 Pilar</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Maybe YOU can afford that!</line>

<stage>Gracie takes a back road to the location of the broken 
 earth.</stage>

<line><actor> Kylee</actor> So, are you ready to tell me yet?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Tell you what?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> The reason why you don't want to go home?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Taking a deep breath) I slept with Clark</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Clark who?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> OUR Clark, Jason Clark</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> (Shrieking) OH MY GOD</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> See? - that's why I didn't want to tell you</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> HOW COULD YOU?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> AT LEAST FAKE SOME SUPPORT</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> That's just wrong!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> PLEASE</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Of all the guys to pick from, why did you do the nasty 
 with him?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I honestly don't know</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Was he good?</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I don't remember</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Why, you dirty tramp!</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Hello, Kettle, will you accept a collect call from 
 Pot?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I, at least, remember mine</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> I didn't know the human brain could count beyond a 
 million?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> I've never done it with a man of color before</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> You mean to tell me Turner is an albino? - what about 
 the other 2000 a month?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Enough with the jokes, Gracie, I set standards for myself</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> What century are you living in, Shepperton? - more 
 importantly, what color am I?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Everyone considers Orientals to be honorary white folk 
 in this country</line>
<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Dear God... and just when I was beginning to slightly 
 like you</line>

<stage>Gracie pulls the van off to the side of the road and 
 starts to set up the equipment. A jeep barrels down towards them.</stage>

<line><actor> Kylee</actor> Looks like someone else is after our crack</line>

<stage>Both are astonished to see a harried Justine and Joenne 
 before them.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Mirabello, do you know where Zach is? - I have been 
 looking...</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> GET BACK IN THE VAN - GO, GO, GO</line>

<stage>Joenne pulls out her machine gun and lets loose behind 
 her as several hoods float in their direction.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> WHAT THE HELL?</line>
<line><actor> Kylee</actor> (Running back to the van) Let's go with the damaged 
 building idea, Gracie!</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> TAKE MY SISTER WITH YOU</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> NO, JOEY</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> I have backup coming for me - I can hold them off - 
 you three need to get outta here, NOW</line>

<stage>Joenne rips a grenade out of her sack and hurls it back 
 at the hoods.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> What is going on here?</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> I'M NOT LEAVING YOU...</line>

<stage>Joenne knocks her sister out with a quick butt to the 
 back of the head.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> Can you teach me how to do that to my parents?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> Sorry, Justi - GRACIE, KYLEE, GET HER IN THE VAN AND 
 LEAVE, GOD DAMMIT</line>

<stage>Gracie and Kylee drag the limp Justine into the van as 
 Joenne hops back into the jeep and heads right for the hoods.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Calling after) DOES KCON GET AN EXCLUSIVE WITH YOU?</line>

<stage>An army helicopter swoops down overhead and fires off 
 several rounds just missing the van.</stage>

<line><actor> Gracie</actor> (Pounding the gas pedal) WE'RE LEAVING, WE'RE LEAVING, 
 WE'RE SO LEAVING...I HATE THIS DAY</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Back at the SCU lab, Erika and Shelby stare at Javier.</stage>

<line><actor> Shelby</actor> I really need to be picking up Calvin - I'll see you 
 two tomorrow</line>

<stage>Before she leaves, Shelby gives Erika a soft hug.</stage>

<line><actor> Shelby</actor> Please go home and be with your family, get some rest</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Not until I find out what I need from Sandy</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> What is it that you need, Rikka?</line>

<stage>Erika remains silent as Shelby leaves the room.</stage>

<line><actor> Javier</actor> (Taking her hand and kissing it) I am so sorry about 
 your father</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Snatching her hand away) Are you?</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> What does that mean?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Could you please take a look in the electron microscope 
 for me?</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> What is it?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Choking back the rage) TAKE A LOOK</line>

<stage>Javier reluctantly does.</stage>

<line><actor> Javier</actor> (Stunned) WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? - HAVE YOU BEEN GOING 
 THROUGH MY FILES?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> So you HAVE been working on this!</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> Look, just because we're all in the same department 
 doesn't mean we need to be a part of each other's projects - you have 
 tons of experiments going on that you keep me, Shel and Tim out of the 
 loop on</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Cool) Who hired you to work on this?</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> How dare you? - it's a personal venture that I...</line>

<stage>Erika stride across the room in two steps, grabs Javier 
 by the throat with one hand and pins him back with the other.
</stage>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c07_erika-sandy.jpg" h="376" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> I'm not going to ask you again, Sandy</line>

<stage>Javier chokes and gags until Erika releases him.</stage>

<line><actor> Javier</actor> WHAT... IN THE HELL... IS WRONG WITH YOU?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Your little personal venture is hurting someone I love</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> Who is it hurting? - I don't understand - I think you're 
 overreacting because of your dad</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> EXACTLY - I need to isolate this toxin quickly and find 
 an antidote - I can do it on my own but it will take too much time... 
 help me or I will make it very ugly for you and your family</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> I don't understand where any of this is coming from 
 - he said it was supposed to be for a cosmetics agent</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> WHO, WHO IS HE?</line>
<line><actor> Javier</actor> Griffin!</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Thrashing around his bedroom at the Quartz Lake Inn, 
 an agitated Joe Tiszo rummages through an old wooden chest.</stage>

<line><actor> Joe</actor> I cannot ignore it any longer... forgive me, my Lord, 
 for I have been a coward far too long!</line>

<stage>He grabs a crystal necklace similar to Amy's and it glows 
 a bright orange in his hand.</stage>

<line><actor> Joe</actor> (Tying it around his neck) Time is running out for everyone</line>

<stage>He now pulls a long, black robe out of the chest and 
 throws it on.
</stage>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c07_hooded_joe.jpg" h="367" w="410"></p>

<line><actor>Joe</actor> (Pulling the hood over his head) Pray for us, Deirdre</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Deep inside the caverns of the Kiyomis, Amethyst stands 
 back and watches helplessly as Morrigan is cornered. Several hoods converge 
 on McBride.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> AMY</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> I'm sorry...</line>

<stage>The white robed leader places a hand on Amethyst's shoulder 
 as Morrigan is quickly bound, gagged and carried off by the hoods.
</stage>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c07_gagged_morri.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>White Robe</actor> You did well, my child</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> (Flinching) I hate you for making me do this</line>
<line><actor> White Robe</actor> Ultimately, it was your decision, wasn't it?</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> Let Zach go, now!</line>
<line><actor> White Robe</actor> Not until the Marked One fulfills her purpose</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> I brought her to you now give me Zachary</line>
<line><actor> White Robe</actor> Our deal will be completed soon - you are more 
 than welcome to watch</line>

<stage>Amethyst tries to throw a punch at the leader but her 
 fist is caught in mid-air and it is squeezed to the point of bones crunching.</stage>

<line><actor> White Robe</actor> Do not test my patience right now</line>

<stage>The leader brushes Amethyst aside and walks away.</stage>

<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> I WILL COME BACK FOR HER... once I take care of Zach, 
 I promise you this!</line>
<line><actor> White Robe</actor> Don't waste your energy, I highly doubt she will 
 survive the ritual</line>

<stage>The leader disappears into the caverns as two brown robed 
 subordinates carry in a badly bruised and blindfolded Isaacson. They 
 pass by Morrigan on their way.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Slipping out of her gag) ZACH, ZACH</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> (Muffled) MORRI?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> GET DARKFIN...</line>

<stage>Before she can say another word, the gag is replaced 
 and she is quickly hauled away.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> WHO?</line>

<stage>Zach is smacked in the jaw and thrown into a cave with 
 Amethyst. Brown hoods surround them both.</stage>

<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> ZACH - oh, my baby, I'm so sorry - are you okay?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Amy? - is that you?</line>

<stage>Amethyst takes the blindfold off and unties him.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> What the fuck is going on here?</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> Shh, relax... can you walk?</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> I think so - why are you dressed like that? - hey, I'm 
 really sorry about the donkey prank at your birthday party last year 
 but this goes way beyond payback!</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> This is not a joke</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> Did I hear Morrigan? - is she here? - who are these psychos?</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> (Whispering) Don't say another word, just be ready 
 to run</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> But...</line>

<stage>The ground starts to tremble again.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> Not another earthquake!

<p> Amethyst (Tears running down her face) No... not an earthquake</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> What's that chanting?</line>

<stage>Amethyst looks up to a small hole in the cave ceiling. 
 It is filled with nighttime stars.</stage>

<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> They have begun the invocation too soon, it will 
 bring even greater disaster upon us</line>

<stage>Clenching her jaw and summoning her strength, Amethyst 
 waves her arm in a flourish. The brown robed guards go crashing against 
 the wall.</stage>

<line><actor> Zach</actor> HOW DID YOU...</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW</line>
<line><actor> Zach</actor> WHAT ABOUT...</line>
<line><actor> Amethyst</actor> (Taking Zach's hand and pulling him) RUN</line>

<stage>Around the cave floor, the leader's chanting quickens 
 and is echoed by a horde of blue robes. The center of the ceremony, 
 Morrigan lies motionless. She is wrapped in a thin gray sheet with her 
 arms and legs exposed. The mark on her foot begins to glow as do the 
 rocks around the cave.</stage>

<line><actor> White Robe</actor> CARRY HER</line>

<stage>Four blue robes take a hold of Morrigan and await their 
 next command.</stage>

<line><actor> White Robe</actor> LET THE MARK LEAD US</line>

<stage>Drawn by a magnetic-like pull, Morrigan's foot is now 
 the center of her gravity. It draws her and her captors slowly down 
 a dark path, a path that lights up with several never-before-seen symbols 
 that glow with intensity.</stage>

<line><actor> White Robe</actor> (Uncontained glee) WE ARE NEAR, WE ARE VERY NEAR</line>

<stage>A dazed and weakened McBride feels her body on fire, 
 her foot begins to bleed again.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Fin...</line>
<line><actor> White Robe</actor> Aleta Oscura isn't here to save you this time, 
 child</line>

<stage>All of the sudden, Morrigan's foot slams down hard on 
 the cave floor, sending a jolt that knocks down everyone but her. She 
 screams in abject pain as rocks and dust tumble around them. A low-level 
 metallic hum fills the room.</stage>

<line><actor> White Robe</actor> HERE, WE SHALL DIG HERE</line>

<stage>A blue robe rushes over to the leader.</stage>

<line><actor> Blue Robe</actor> But the timing, Master - the timing is slightly 
 off</line>
<line><actor> White Robe</actor> I AM DONE WAITING - IT IS NOW MY TIME</line>

<stage>Both are horrified at the sight of Morrigan gracefully 
 levitating upright from the floor. She floats peacefully up to a precipice 
 and into the waiting arms of Joe Tiszo.</stage>

<line><actor> Joe</actor> (Eyes glowing) IT IS NOW YOUR TIME... YOUR TIME TO DIE</line>

<bar></bar>
