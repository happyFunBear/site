<chapter-title>Sand on Asphalt</chapter-title> 

<stage>Inside the von Meer estate, everyone has left except for a few close 
 friends and family. Joe is helping Pauline make arrangements as KJ and 
 Ona Rosa watch from the kitchen.</stage>

<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> (Rubbing his shoulder) You know, KJ, you should lie 
 down and get some rest</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Can't... I cannot even try to sleep right now</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> No one is talking about sleep</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> I need to be here for my mom</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> Joe is helping her and I'll do anything she asks</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Thank you, Oni</line>

<stage>The two linger in a long hug.</stage>

<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> (Suddenly stepping away) Um... I was watching the 
 news</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> I suppose they're looking for an official family statement 
 about dad?</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> Um... yes - but I was watching it for Morrigan</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> DID THEY FIND HER?</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> No... not yet</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Slamming his fist against the wall) GOD DAMMIT - this 
 is all just too insane - my girlfriend is being hunted by cops, my father...</line>

<stage>He goes to wipe the tears from his eyes.</stage>

<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> (Handing him a tissue) I know</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Oh, and judging by the broken dishes and crooked pictures 
 in the house, we had a nice little quake to go along with everything 
 else</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> It only caused minor damage</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> And your sister... dear God, she nearly died in a helicopter 
 crash!</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> 'Nita is strong - it will take a lot more than that 
 to bring her down</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Why are you here?</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> What?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Why are you here with me instead of at home with your family... 
 your kids... Javier?</line>

<stage>As she stumbles around for an answer, he moves closer to her.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> It means everything that you wanted to be here with me</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> (Trying to avoid eye contact) I just wanted to help</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> You are</line>

<stage>He bends in to kiss her on the lips. She hesitates at first but 
 allows it to happen. A second one follows in which Oni equally participates 
 in.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c05_kj_ona.jpg" h="506" w="510"></p>
<line><actor>Ona Rosa</actor> (Pulling back) No...</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> But...</line>
<line><actor> Ona Rosa</actor> My children need me... I've got to go</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Oni, wait!</line>

<stage>She runs out of the house and KJ quickly follows. He is nearly knocked 
 over in the driveway by Griffin in his car.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> WATCH IT, MAN</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> GET IN THE CAR, KJ</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> I can't leave mom at a time like this</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> (Watching Ona Rosa take off) Looks like you were about 
 to do just that</line>

<stage>KJ reluctantly gets in the passenger seat.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> Where are we going?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> To work</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Are you serious? - I have to stay here and...</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> And what? - stand around and mourn? - I really am 
 sorry about your father but the time for being your own man begins right 
 now</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> You should talk</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Hey, I am the only one looking out for ALL of our 
 interests - do you see your sister around?</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> She's not back with your mom yet?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> I don't know where they went, besides, that's the 
 least of our concerns - we have a critical PCOC board meeting and YOU 
 need to be there</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Dude, that's always been your call - why do you need me 
 there?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Because your father had a say in it as well - remember, 
 &quot;Meeramar&quot; as in &quot;von Meer&quot; AND &quot;Martel&quot;... 
 or, you could just sell us your family's half of the company and we'll 
 gladly change it to &quot;Martel Shipping&quot;</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Old Doug would just love that, wouldn't he?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Yes, my father certainly would - I'm sure that's his 
 primary goal right now</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Then why are you trying to help us?</line>

<stage>The two look at each other.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Shaking his head) Look, I don't want to be some fucking 
 chess piece between your hatred for your dad and your love for my sister</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> This isn't about them - it's about having allies I 
 can trust to back me up when the time comes</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> What the hell are you talking about? - what time? - you 
 make it sound like we're going to war</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> That's what business is - you're a lawyer, you should 
 know this!</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Ugh... I am sorry, I'm trying to deal with all different 
 emotions right now, I can't think straight</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> YOU NEED TO DO SO - granted, I am the one being groomed 
 to take over the business, and rightfully so, but I want you to be the 
 one representing the von Meers</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> My sister is better for this - dad thought so and I thought 
 you did too?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> She is a scientist, first and foremost - she sees 
 things in black and white - all environmental issues wouldn't stand 
 a chance against her</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> Oh, I see - I'm just some dumbass meat puppet you can easily 
 control to help you rape nature, is that it?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> THAT IS NOT IT AT ALL - YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT 
 - your background in law allows you to see all possibilities, we are 
 going to need that in the months ahead</line>
<line><actor> KJ</actor> WHAT IS THIS BIG THING THAT'S HAPPENING?</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> You're about to find out, my friend</line>

<stage>Moments later, the two pull into the corporate parking structure 
 and head for the main building. KJ hesitates as they walk towards the 
 executive boardroom.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> I'm not sure I'm up to this</line>
<line><actor> Griffin</actor> Your sister isn't here - your father is dead - your 
 mother... please - do you want to call in your cousins from back east 
 to take over?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> No</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> A real man shines greatest in moments of true adversity 
 - you have your father's name... don't you think it's time you lived 
 up to it?</line>

<stage>The two walk in to a large, darkened room with several non-PCOC 
 maps and charts highlighting the walls.</stage>

<line><actor> KJ</actor> (Swallowing hard as he looks around) I take it this isn't 
 a meeting about switching from winter to summer blends of gas?</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>After a long moment of silence in the Quartz Lake Inn wine cellar, 
 Morrigan breaks the hug and starts to question Erika.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I... I don't understand - what's going on with your 
 dad?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Someone tried to poison him</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Who?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I have every intention of finding out</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Why did you bring him here?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> It was the only safe place Stephanie and I could think 
 of</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> How did Hector Tapia become involved?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Are the &quot;when&quot; and &quot;where&quot; questions 
 next?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I'm sorry</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> You never stop being a reporter, do you?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Do you ever stop being a scientist?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Looking away) On occasion</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Well, you'll have to show me sometime</line>

<stage>Erika stifles a laugh to herself.</stage>

<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Does KJ know he's alive?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No... and neither does my mother - they can't</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You can't even trust your own family?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> The less people who know means whoever did this can't 
 try it again</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> The anguish they must be going through!</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> My father is still very critical - I don't want them 
 to go through his death twice</line>

<stage>Morrigan reaches out a hand of comfort to Erika but the von Meer 
 daughter rigidly refuses it.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> (Noticing Morrigan's bandage) What happened to your 
 foot?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Just a cut</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Let me see</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> (Backing away) IT'S FINE</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I don't want it to get infected</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Am... a friend took care of it - I need to leave</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Where are you going to go?</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I don't know, but I can't stay here and risk the 
 police finding me AND your father</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We're going to put him in a suite here - Joe will keep 
 quiet, no one will know</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> That's great but...</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> We can put you in an adjoining suite - you can look 
 after him for us!</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I don't know</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> No, this is perfect - Steph needs to go back to work, 
 Hector wants out ASAP, Joe can't watch him every second and it will 
 give me a chance to find out what's going on</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Are you sure?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Knowing exactly where both of you are and that you're 
 safe will be a huge comfort to me</line>

<stage>Morrigan raises an eyebrow.</stage>

<line><actor> Erika</actor> On behalf of my brother</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Of course</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Steph and I will show you what to do - you simply stay 
 in the room, Joe will take care of everything until we figure out what 
 the next move is</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> You know, just in case you missed the APB, I am wanted 
 for murder - you're still willing to trust me with your dad?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I know you didn't kill that priest - I couldn't have 
 asked for a better person to take care of my father right now</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> Thank you... that means a lot</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> I'm just stating the obvious</line>
<line><actor> Morrigan</actor> I... have a friend that's helping me - I wonder if 
 she'll she be able to find me?</line>
<line><actor> Erika</actor> Don't worry, I'm sure she will</line>

<stage>After searching all over town for her sister, an exhausted Justine 
 returns to her apartment. A nervous Joenne cocks a submachine gun at 
 her head as she walks in.</stage>

<line><actor> Justine</actor> JESUS, JOIE</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Putting down the weapon) Thank God it's you!</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> DO YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING 
 ON?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> No time... help me pack</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> PACK?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Throwing stuff in boxes) I've seen too much, I need 
 to go</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> Go where? - I have been looking for you all night 
 and day - Zach has been searching for Gracie - do you know where she 
 is? - how exactly are you involved with Morrigan's mess?</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> McBride is just an aspect to it - I can't tell you 
 anymore right now</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> (Wagging her finger) You BETTER tell me more because 
 this is complete bullsh...</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Covering her mouth) You are my sister and I love you 
 - I know how much you want to be married with children someday, that's 
 why I want you to be safe - and why I have to leave at once</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> It's too late for that - I know all about the creature 
 known as &quot;Father Greg&quot;</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> What are you talking about?</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> A-HA... I'll tell you my story IF you tell me yours!</line>
<line><actor> Joenne</actor> This is NOT a game, Justi!</line>
<line><actor> Justine</actor> Seems like a VERY big game to me - you can start off 
 by explaining why a temp secretary like you possesses a massive assault 
 weapon?</line>

<stage>A large thud is heard outside of the door.</stage>

<line><actor> Joenne</actor> (Pulling her sister) WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE, 
 NOW</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Walking along the bustling Duquesa Bay marina, Marcy chatters endlessly 
 while Anita half-heartedly nibbles at an ice-cream cone.</stage>

<line><actor> Marcy</actor> So, Tamarah calls me up the other day - she's a make-up 
 artist whose brother I helped get a crew job on Sig7 - we've all been 
 friends for years...</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> That's nice</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> Anyway, she keeps me on the phone for TWO hours complaining 
 about how she can't find a decent man</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> (Scuffing her sandals) Uh-huh</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> I'm like DUH - get the hell out of LA and what does 
 she do? - Anita, are you listening?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Listening, yes - caring, no</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> Well, TRY... for my sake</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> OK, what does she do?</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> SHE MOVES TO FREAKING NEW YORK CITY</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> (Shrugging her shoulders) And?</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> AND? - COME ON, the only thing men in both LA and NYC 
 care about are who they can screw in business and in the bedroom</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> And this comes from personal knowledge?</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> It's like sand on asphalt - it looks secure but when 
 you go to step on it, you end up flat on your ass</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> With your legs spread wide open?</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> Stop it</line>

<stage>A couple of young fans spot Marcy and run over for autographs. She 
 reluctantly obliges and they walk off in smiles. A buff guy in trendy 
 shades and on roller blades whizzes by the two women and whistles his 
 appreciation at the attractive actress.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> Funny... you have yet to sign my cast</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> (Winking) I gave you my personal autograph elsewhere</line>

<stage>The guy on roller blades now circles back.</stage>

<line><actor> Guy</actor> WOOOOO - BOGREE IS A HUMAN HOTTIE</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> Thank you! - now, where was I... OH, so I tell Tamarah 
 that the only people these men are capable of loving are themselves 
 - if she wants the Holly Hobbie Good Housekeeping life, I told her to 
 try some mid-western shit state like Duluth</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Duluth is a city, not a state</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> You seem very uppity today, why?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Nothing more sex wouldn't cure</line>

<stage>The guy circles back again.</stage>

<line><actor> Guy</actor> (Singing) LIFE'S LITTLE LESSONS - I HAVE A FEW LESSONS 
 I'D LIKE TO TEACH YOU, JAAAMIEEE</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> SON OF A...</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> Just ignore him, it's par for the course - we'll take 
 care of the sex part later, why don't you try talking to me about what's 
 going on with you instead hiding behind this passive aggressive behavior?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> FINE - I get blown out of the sky last night and a mermaid 
 saves me from an evil band of hooded terrorists - HAPPY NOW?</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> WOW - what pharmaceutical are you flipped on?</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Why, want some?</line>
<line><actor> Marcy</actor> You know about my past - that's an extremely low shot, 
 even for you!</line>
<line><actor> Anita</actor> Sorry... I'm really tired - tired of trying to fight 
 something I don't understand - tired of me and my CO getting suspended 
 for something we had no control over - tired of my loco family and the 
 drama that goes with them - tired of trying to separate myth from reality 
 - tired of fucking you for hours and then helping you pick out new swim 
 trunks for Ned - I'm tired of your het privilege while I'm the one who 
 endures the hate taunts - I'm tired of the chunks of cookie dough in 
 this ice cream...</line>

<stage>The guy on roller blades returns for another pass at the two. This 
 time, Anita throws one solid punch with her cast-enforced arm into his 
 stomach. The guy is sent flying back and crumples down to the pavement, 
 trying to catch his breath.</stage>

<line><actor> Anita</actor> (Grabbing her wrist) And I am REALLY tired of him!
