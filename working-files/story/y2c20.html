<chapter-title>Through The Hooking Glass</chapter-title>

<stage>Staggering around her lair under the island 
 of Concha Dos, Darkfin tries to figure out what exactly what went 
 wrong with the fresh-water transmogrification.

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Clutching her head) This... this is 
 bad</line>

<stage>Her hand shaking, she throws her pen aside 
 and takes out a mini tape recorder.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Squinting at her watch) It's been 
 about five hours since I took a dive in the family duck pond - the 
 morph was complete but everything else... is completely off the scale 
 - temperature fluctuations, hypersensitivity, severe aggressive behavior... 
 I nearly fed on Ben's youngest</line>

<stage>Taking her vital signs, she slumps down 
 and sits cross-legged on the sandy ground.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> I have the overwhelming urge to jump 
 into the seawater before me again but I'm afraid it might trigger 
 a more adverse reaction - I need to revert to a fully human state 
 once more</line>

<stage>Shivering, Aleta Oscura reaches over to 
 a trunk and pulls out a wool blanket.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Wrapping herself up in it) It's so... 
 so cold</line>

<stage>She glances up to still see the earlier 
 IM chat she had with Morrigan still on the screen.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Exhaling slowly) You are going to 
 have to get through tonight without me - I need to rest... recuperate... 
 DAMMIT</line>

<stage>Images of a smiling McBride, ominously 
 surrounded by hooded figures, flashes in Aleta Oscura's mind.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Rubbing her eyes) Yet, I also have 
 an overwhelming fear that something is horribly wrong - I must go 
 ashore!</line>

<stage>Not noticing the urgent e-mail from KJ 
 now flashing on the screen, Darkfin tosses off the blanket and summons 
 the trident into her hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> Two hours back by boat is too long, 
 I need to swim, I need to go... NOW</line>

<stage>Hurling herself into the water with every 
 ounce of strength she has, Darkfin feels no immediate reaction. She 
 continues to swim across the ocean towards Duquesa Bay. Upon surfacing, 
 there is a drastic change in her coloring.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Staring down at her body) So much 
 for camouflage
</line>

<stage>Finishing her evening rounds at Bay Valley 
 Medical Center, Dr. Stephanie Gates prepares to leave.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (On her cell phone) I will not have 
 this argument with you again, Hector... no, I will not meet you there, 
 leave it alone!</line>

<stage>She snaps the phone shut and returns some 
 charts to the nurse's front desk.</stage>

<line><actor>Nurse</actor> All set, doctor?</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Pretty much - it looks like it's 
 going to be a quiet night - please be sure to check Mr. Wilkins' Foley 
 in twenty minuets</line>
<line><actor>Nurse</actor> No problem - any fun plans?</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Sighing) I finally thought I'd have 
 the opportunity to see my daughter but, surprisingly, she's busy</line>
<line><actor>Nurse</actor> (Checking her computer screen) Ooh, got 
 a new one rolling in - a 62-year-old white male, possible MI</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Walking away) Not my problem, I'm 
 officially off duty</line>
<line><actor>Nurse</actor> Uh, it says here the patient's name is 
 Karl von Meer</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Freezing) KARL?
</line>
<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/y2c20_steph.jpg" h="466" w="478"></image>

<line><actor>Nurse</actor> The ETA is two minutes</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Running) CALL THE TRAUMA TEAM AND 
 TELL THEM I'M ON MY WAY</line>

<stage>The ambulance finally arrives and rushes 
 in Karl with a panicked Pauline and KJ beside him.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> WHAT HAPPENED?</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Sobbing) We were just having dinner... 
 and he... he slumped over - HELP HIM, PLEASE</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Did he eat something bad, was he 
 choking at all?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> No, no... not that we could tell!</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Hitting her son on his arm) FIND YOUR 
 SISTER, NOW</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Exasperated) I'M TRYING, I'VE TRIED EVERY 
 WAY TO CONTACT HER, SHE'S NOT ANSWERING</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> THEN GO OUT THERE AND LOOK FOR HER, 
 KJ</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I SHOULD STAY</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> I want you two to wait out here, 
 I'll let you know as soon as I know something, I promise</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> I'M NOT LEAVING HIM</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> MOM - please, let her work, we'll just be 
 outside!</line>

<stage>Giving a reassuring squeeze to Pauline's 
 hand and a quick nod to KJ, Stephanie closes off the ER room and attends 
 to the elder von Meer.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (To the EMT) What are his vitals?</line>
<line><actor>EMT</actor> BP 90/60 and dropping fast, pulse is erratic 
 at 150, shallow breathing, in and out of consciousness...
</line>
<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/ysc20_karlsr_gurney.jpg" h="430" w="520"></image>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Checking Karl out herself) DAMMIT</line>
<line><actor>EMT</actor> Two lines were started en route but we 
 can't get a good flow going</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> His color is bad... KARL, KARL, CAN 
 YOU HEAR ME?</line>

<stage>His eyes slowly flutter open for a moment.</stage>

<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> Steph?</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> Yes, Karl, right here - can you tell 
 me anything?</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> (Struggling) You... you need...</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Leaning closer to him) What?</line>
<line><actor>Karl Sr.</actor> To protect her...</line>

<stage>He abruptly vomits a putrid substance 
 into his oxygen mask.</stage>

<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> (Clearing his airway) DEAR GOD, WHAT 
 IS THAT SMELL?</line>
<line><actor>EMT</actor> HE'S CRASHING</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> GIVE ME A BAG</line>
<line><actor>EMT</actor> PULSELESS V-TAC</line>
<line><actor>Stephanie</actor> CHARGE THE PADDLES... HOLD ON, KARL, 
 PLEASE</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>With lights and sirens blaring, several 
 cop cars pull up to Morrigan McBride's residence. The two lead detectives 
 strut up to the front door and bang on it.</stage>

<line><actor>Detective 1</actor> OPEN UP, MS. MCBRIDE, WE HAVE A 
 WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST</line>
<line><actor>Detective 2</actor> PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS DIFFICULT</line>

<stage>An officer hurries over to them from around 
 the garage.</stage>

<line><actor>Officer</actor> No one's home - I checked the main 
 house and there's no sign of the landlady, either!</line>
<line><actor>Detective 1</actor> (Smacking the door) SHIT</line>
<line><actor>Detective 2</actor> PUT OUT AN IMMEDIATE APB FOR BOTH</line>

<stage>With the sirens blaring behind in the 
 distance, Morrigan stumbles along the creekside, using the brush for 
 cover. The hand of a nude Amy is forcefully pulling her.
</stage>

<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/y2c20_amy_morri.jpg" h="495" w="620"></image>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Out of breath) STOP... AMY, STOP, 
 PLEASE</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Wincing at her cut, bare feet) You 
 didn't even give me a chance to put on my shoes!</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Looking up at the sky) There is no 
 time</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I really appreciate what you're trying 
 to do for me... but I can't outrun the police</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> It's not the police I'm worried about... 
 C'MON</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Why are you naked? - what is that 
 light coming from your crystal?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Sharp tone) WHY IS THE BOTTOM OF 
 YOUR LEFT FOOT GLOWING?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> OH, GREAT</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Let's go, we're almost there</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Where?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> TRUST ME, MORRIGAN, YOU HAVE TO...</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Inside his recently purchased storefront, 
 Brad Martel reluctantly goes through some paperwork.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> (To himself) I'll show you, father, Griffin 
 is NOT the only Martel that can handle a business</line>

<stage>Doug and Stephanie's youngest turns up 
 the sound system and blasts the music of a local industrial band he 
 manages. He does not hear Penelope Renselier enter.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Sneaking up behind him and covering 
 his eyes) Is that a new track from &quot;Ministers of Toxin?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Jumping) FUCK</line>

<stage>Brad pushes her off and steps back to 
 see the startled girl.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> PENNY... whoa, I am so sorry - I didn't 
 know it was you</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Trying not to look hurt) Obviously</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Trying to hug her) C'mere</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Now pushing him off) GO TO HELL</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Seriously, it's not a wise move to be 
 lurking around in an abandoned building, especially in this part of 
 town</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Smirking) You seem to be perfectly comfortable 
 here</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I was... until you made me soak my shorts</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Soaked with exactly what?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> As much as I get off on your little nympho-tease 
 routine, I'm not in the mood tonight</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> That's unlike you, Bradley</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Going back to his paperwork) Tell me 
 about it - why aren't you with your mom at that museum meeting?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> She's a big girl, she can handle it without 
 me... make someone else carry her coffee for once</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> And good old Uncle George?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Miffed) In the state hole called &quot;Sacto&quot; 
 or the sub hole called &quot;Tim&quot; - one or the other... or both</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Should I ask my dad to talk to him?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> It's no use... let's change the subject 
 please</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> OK</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Biting her lip) You know, we haven't 
 even decided on a name for this place yet</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Checking a calculator) I think &quot;Weird 
 Crap For Sale&quot; says it all</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Is there anything I can do to help?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Not looking at her) Go home</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Pissed) ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> LOOK, I need to concentrate and I can't 
 do that if I'm staring at your tits all night!</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Smiling and flashing her bra) You'd 
 only STARE at my tits all night?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Rubbing his flushed cheeks) What is it, 
 a full moon out tonight or something? - why don't you go play with 
 your puppy dog and let a real man get back to work?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> HEY, YOU WANTED ME IN THIS BUSINESS WITH 
 YOU</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I do and I want to get this business off 
 the frigging ground but that's taking more time and more money than 
 I had originally planned</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> I can help you, I'm smart</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I KNOW you are but I need to get this 
 paperwork finished by morning</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Folding her arms and walking off in 
 a huff) Fine, maybe I WILL go play with my puppy dog... Jeremy is 
 awesome at licking my face!</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Before she reaches the door) WAIT</line>

<stage>Penelope stifles a grin and slowly turns 
 around.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> Yeeeees?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Sighing) Amy was here earlier today setting 
 up a bunch of her candles and crystals in the back room</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Jealous tone) Amy?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Amethyst Hill</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Yeah, I know who she is</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Maybe you could double-check the SKU's?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> SKU's?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> &quot;Stock Keeping Unit&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Right...</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Thanks</line>

<stage>Brad, once again, attempts to finish his 
 paperwork when Penelope shrieks loudly from the other room.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Scrambling over) WHAT'S WRONG?</line>

<stage>He is astonished by the state of the room. 
 It is filled in every corner with lit candles, strategically placed 
 crystals hanging from the ceiling, and elaborate chalk drawings.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> WHAT THE FUCK DID SHE DO IN HERE?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Delighted) You lying bastard...</line>

<stage>Penelope goes up to Brad and kisses him 
 passionately on the lips.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> You knew I was coming all along</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Still baffled) Um...</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Backing him against a wall) You always 
 know when I'm coming... I can't believe you staged this whole thing 
 just to get between my legs</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I... I... yeah, OK, whatever</line>

<stage>Unable to resist any longer, Brad now 
 initiates the kissing and the two begin to consume each other. Amy 
 and Morrigan burst through the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> AAAAHHH</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Sorry to interrupt</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Scanning around) What are we doing 
 here?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I WAS ABOUT TO ASK THE SAME THING</line>

<stage>With a quick jerk, Penelope knees Brad 
 in the groin.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Eyeing the naked Amy) YOU SICK FUCK, 
 NO WAY AM I DOING A THREE-WAY</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (His voice an octave higher) I HAVE NO 
 IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON, HONESTLY, I DON'T</line>

<stage>Falling into a cross-legged position in 
 the corner, Amethyst begins to rock and chant loudly.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Turning to Morrigan) What is she doing?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I don't know</line>

<stage>Morrigan studies Brad and Penny for a 
 moment.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Slapping Brad hard across the face) 
 HOW OLD IS THIS GIRL, DUDE?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> DON'T SLAP HIM</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Near tears) I DIDN'T TOUCH HER</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> YOUR HAND UP HER SHIRT SAYS OTHERWISE</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> MIND YOUR BUSINESS, LADY, WHY ARE YOU 
 EVEN HERE?</line>

<stage>The whole building begins to shake.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Ducking and covering) EARTHQUAKE</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> MORRIGAN, GET IN THE CENTER OF THE 
 ROOM, NOW</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> WHY?</line>

<stage>The increasing sound of deep chanting 
 is now heard from outside of the building as an eerie glow floods 
 the windows.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> DOES ANYONE ELSE HEAR THAT?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Pleading with McBride) JUST DO IT, 
 DO IT NOW</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> DON'T OPEN THE DOOR
</line>
<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/y2c20_morri_taken.jpg" h="543" w="515"></image>


<stage>As Morrigan heads for the center of the 
 room, her left foot is instantly drawn up to the center of a pictogram 
 on the ceiling. She screams in pain as Brad and Penny watch helplessly 
 and Amethyst continues to chant.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Captain Phelps and Lieutenant Fiore patrol 
 the marina in their USCG helicopter.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Looking at his watch) Is this wise?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Our sources say the police will be arresting 
 McBride anytime now</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Maybe we should be hovering over her 
 house?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> No, we need to be hovering over Aleta 
 Oscura's casa - and we are</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> What if she's already on shore?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> We have a tail on our KCON chica, she's 
 all alone except for her wacky landlady and a couple of cats</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Softly) Amethyst Hill?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Yeah... enjoying a pleasant flashback?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> That was a few years ago</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Chuckling) I remember</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> She gave great head but was too much 
 of a space case for me</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Amy's a lot less maintenance than your 
 current &quot;warrior moon queen&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> That's debatable</line>

<stage>A slight bump is felt throughout the helicopter.</stage>

<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/y2c20_chopper.jpg" h="379" w="620"></image>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> What was that?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> You probably hit an air pocket... or 
 a bird</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> It didn't feel like that at all - something 
 else is wrong</line>

<stage>The lieutenant checks her instruments.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> We've taken on weight!</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> How is that possible?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> HOLD ON, I'M GOING TO TRY A FEW MANEUVERS</line>

<stage>She attempts two sudden turns and then 
 comes to slow hover near the shore.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> Everything seems to be fine - I don't 
 understand it</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> CHECK OUT YOUR BRACELET</line>

<stage>Anita glances down and notices it all 
 aglow.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Poking at it) JESUS
</line>
<p a="center"><image  src="../graphics/y2c20_anita.jpg" h="520" w="620"></image>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> Is it some bizarre Saint Elmo's Fire 
 type deal?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I have no clue, it's only done this a 
 few other times before - my folks freaked out when it did</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> I think we better head back to base</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> NO... she's here - can't you sense it? 
 - I bet that's what the weight is... KEEP IT STEADY FOR ME, PHELPS</line>

<stage>Anita twists her body and tries to search 
 the back of the helicopter. She now cranes her neck out of the door 
 and attempts to look under it.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Barely audible) Fiore</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> ONE SEC... I THINK I SEE SOMETHING... 
 IT'S HER, SHE'S HITCHING A RIDE</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Louder) Fiore</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> CAN YOU BANK LEFT A BIT?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Shouting) FIORE</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Returning) WHAT, CRAIG, WHAT IS YOUR 
 PROBLEM?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Pointing) THERE... ON THE CLIFF</line>

<stage>Anita follows his stare and is horrified 
 by what she sees.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> TELL ME YOU SEE THAT</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> I... I do</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> MY GOD</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Save us all!</line>
