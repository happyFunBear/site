<p a="center">WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT...</p>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_df_chopper.jpg" h="456" w="810"> </p>

<stage>The USCG helicopter, carrying Anita, Craig 
 and Darkfin heads towards the massive sea cliff where two dozen hooded 
 figures await their arrival.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> Do... do you see them?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> My eyes are wide open</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Trying to look at them through his Nightvision 
 scope) Who... WHAT ARE THEY? </line>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_craig_nightvision.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Starting to perspire) I'm not sure I want to 
 find out</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Trying to keep calm) MAYBE... maybe it's some 
 kind of fraternity prank... or, or Sig7 is shooting a scene...</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> OR MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST BACK THE HELL OFF</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> GREAT IDEA, LET'S GO</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Struggling with her controls) SHIT, WE'RE LOSING 
 POWER</line>

<stage>Lieutenant Fiore tries to bank hard but 
 can't. Warning lights and alarms blare throughout the cockpit.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> CAN'T MOVE... DAMN, FISH BITCH, GET OFF OF MY 
 TAIL</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Peering down at Darkfin) IS SHE CAUSING THIS?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Smacking her dead radio in frustration) I DON'T 
 KNOW BE SHE SURE CAN'T BE HELPING, GET HER OFF</line>

<stage>Craig takes out his handgun and tries to 
 aim it out the door.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> TRY TO HOLD IT STEADY, ANITA</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> SAVE SOME AMMO FOR THOSE FREAK AHEAD OF US</line>

<stage>Suddenly, the helicopter jerks violently 
 and zooms forward towards the cliff.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> AAAAHHHHH</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> HOLD ON, HOLD ON</line>

<stage>Underneath the helicopter, Aleta Oscura 
 realizes her ride is in serious trouble.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Still staring at the hoods ahead of her) Not 
 playing fair now, are we?</line>

<stage>With trident in hand, Darkfin flips off 
 and lands right into a ring of hoods.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> That is alright, I have no intention of playing 
 fair tonight, either</line>

<stage>They instantly surround her.</stage>

<line><actor>Lead Hood</actor> (Noticing her color change) 
 Vibrant... but you are still no match for us</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Bearing her teeth) We shall see!</line>

<stage>Anita regains control of the helicopter 
 at the last possible second and veers up.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> SANTA MARIA, THANK GOD</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> GET US OUT OF HERE, FIORE</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Trying to guide the helicopter forward) I CAN'T 
 SHAKE LOOSE</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> WHY ARE WE JUST HOVERING? - IS DARKFIN STILL HANGING 
 ON?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Scanning out her window) SHE'S DOWN THERE WITH 
 THE OTHERS... OOOWWWW, WHAT THE?</line>

<stage>The lieutenant's left hand is now mysteriously 
 slammed and pinned up against the window, causing both glass and bone 
 to crack. Her bracelet is all aglow.
</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_anita_chopper.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Bewildered) WHY IS IT DOING THAT?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Her wrist now bleeding) AAAHHHH, I CAN'T MOVE 
 IT - DAMMIT - THEY HAVE US IN SOME KIND OF HOLDING PATTERN</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Startled at the sight of the hoods) JESUS, THEY'RE 
 GLOWING, TOO</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Smelling smoke) THE TORQUE IS GOING TO BLOW THE 
 ENGINE, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> IF WE JUMP FROM THIS HEIGHT, WE'LL DAMAGE SOMETHING 
 FOR SURE</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> IF WE DON'T JUMP, WE'RE TOAST - GET READY, CAPTAIN</line>

<stage>On the ground, Darkfin is successfully battling 
 her opponents</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Shifting) ONE</line>

<stage>She breaks the neck of a hood with a quick 
 snap.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Shoving) TWO 
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_df_fight.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>
<stage>She rams her trident through two others.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Flinging) THREE</line>

<stage>She throws three more off of the cliff.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Checking around) Does anyone really want me 
 to count to ten?</line>

<stage>Off to the side, the Lead Hood is trying 
 desperately to summon Aleta Oscura's trident away from her.</stage>

<line><actor>Lead Hood</actor> (Frustrated) I... I don't 
 understand...</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Twirling her trident around in a flourish) 
 Try understanding this... I modulated my frequency, now it is time to 
 modulate yours!</line>

<stage>She pitches herself at the Lead Hood and 
 slashes at it with her arm fin.</stage>

<line><actor>Lead Hood</actor> (Clutching his shoulder) 
 AARRRGGH... nice move, but it is not enough, it will never be enough</line>

<stage>Before she can deliver a final blow to her 
 enemy, it seemingly disappears into the fog.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> I have got to figure out how they do that</line>

<stage>As the fighting takes place, Joenne Mirabello 
 is camouflaged in the hilly fields behind the cliff. She is observing 
 the entire scene in front of her.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Amazed by Darkfin's presence) 
 UNREAL... this thing keeps getting more and more unreal</line>

<stage>She hastily unpacks several gear bags while 
 speaking into a communication device.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> ALL UNITS, ALL UNITS, GRID TANGO 
 FIVE - CODE BLACK, REPEAT CODE BLACK... I'm going to be hurting here, 
 boys, you better come on through for me!</line>

<stage>Joenne suddenly notices the glowing eyes 
 of a pair of hoods trained directly on her. They alert the others and 
 all of them now switch their sole focus to her.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Gasping) Uh-oh</line>

<stage>They begin to float in her direction.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Quickly assembling a rocket 
 launcher) UH-OH</line>

<stage>Meanwhile, still hovering directly above 
 the chaos, Anita and Craig prepare to jump from the helicopter.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> READY...</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> SET...</line>

<stage>Joenne takes aim at the group of hoods.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> FIRE 
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_joenne_rocket.jpg" h="548" w="460"></p>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Jumping) GOOOO</line>

<stage>The rocket blasts off of Joenne's shoulder 
 but instead of hitting her target, the hoods somehow manage to deflect 
 it into the helicopter.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> NOOOO</line>

<stage>It explodes into a fireball as Craig and 
 Anita tumble to the ground. The captain is knocked unconscious while 
 Anita lands in a bush. The explosion, giving Joenne an opportunity to 
 retreat, momentarily stuns the remaining hoods.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Wracked with pain) CRAIG, CRAIG, COME ON, GET 
 UP</line>

<stage>As she crawls over to her captain, a hooded 
 figure stands before her with a large, ornate dagger.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Holding up her arm in defense) AAAYYYY</line>

<stage>The hooded figure freezes at the sight of 
 her bracelet. As it starts to back away, it backs right into the prongs 
 of Darkfin's trident.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Pushing the skewered hood off of it with her 
 foot) Always look behind you</line>

<stage>For a brief moment, Darkfin and Anita stare 
 at each other. The lieutenant notices that her bracelet is now glowing 
 a same eerie green color as Aleta Oscura's weapon.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Grabbing the hood's dagger) YOU</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Glancing at the motionless Craig) Help will 
 be here shortly</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> WAIT A MINUTE</line>

<stage>Disobeying the request, Darkfin runs and 
 twirls in the air, sending herself over the cliff and back into the 
 ocean.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> NOW WHAT?</line>

<stage>The ground abruptly begins to shake.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>On the other side of town, Brad Martel and 
 Penny Renselier hold on for dear life as the building tumbles down around 
 them.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Covering his head and hers) NO, STAY IN THE DOORWAY, 
 STAY IN THE DOORWAY</line>

<stage>Penny screams as it turns pitch dark in 
 the store. Boxes and bricks continue to fly in every direction. Moments 
 later, the ruckus dies down and Brad lights the dusty air with a glow 
 stick from one of his product lines.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Grabbing her face) Pen, are you OK?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Trying not to cry but unable to do so) Yeah... 
 I think</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> LOOK AT THIS PLACE... or what's left of it</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Brad...</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Kicking a brick) What's the sense of restocking 
 when WE DON'T HAVE A BUILDING ANYMORE - WE'VE CLOSED BEFORE WE EVEN 
 OPENED</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> BRAD - WHERE ARE AMY AND THAT NEWS CHICK?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Huh?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Shrieking) WHERE DID THEY GO?</line>

<stage>The two now turn their attention to a giant 
 pile of rubble before them.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> Oh, man!</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Holding herself) You don't think?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Running over to it) START DIGGING</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Drifting in an out of some kind of stupor, 
 Morrigan McBride realizes that she is stumbling along a dirt path with 
 Amethyst Hill, still naked and still leading the way.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Distorted vision) Look at all the pretty beads 
 hanging... just hanging</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Those are grapes, Honey, we're in a vineyard</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Opening her mouth) I want some</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Maybe we'll get you some of the liquid kind 
 later, keep moving</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Wide eyed) Why are we here?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Pointing to the city lights in the distance) 
 Because you don't want to be over there</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Why?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You're worse than the three year-old down the 
 street, keep moving!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Holding her head) I can't... I can't get my 
 balance</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Neither can anyone else in the entire valley 
 right now... including the cops, keep moving</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Fixating on her glowing crystal) Ooh, pretty</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Pushing away Morri's hand) Don't touch</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Why are you doing this?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Pausing and looking directly at her friend 
 and tenant) Because it's necessary... YOU are necessary</line>

<stage>With that, she once again pulls a dazed 
 Morrigan along and they head into a labyrinth of tunnels under the Quartz 
 Lake Inn.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Anguished) Ouch, my leg, I can't walk on it 
 much longer</line>

<stage>Amy stares down at Morrigan's glowing and 
 profusely bleeding foot.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Lean more on me, we're just around the corner...</line>

<stage>Doing so, Morrigan is barely able to make 
 out her surroundings. She does recognize a wine cellar and a small cot 
 in the corner.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Setting her down and lighting some candles) 
 Rest here, I'll be right back</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Panicked) Where... where are you going 
 to? 
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_morri_amy.jpg" h="455" w="510"></p>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> I'm getting something for your foot</line>

<stage>Minutes pass by as Morrigan tries to focus 
 her eyes on the bottles of wine before her. As promised, Amy returns 
 with a first aid kit.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Disappointed) No magical mudpack and leaf 
 treatment?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Wrapping the foot) Not this time, I'm afraid... 
 this, however, should stop the bleeding</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It no longer burns... thank you</line>

<stage>The light to Amy's crystal begins to lose 
 intensity.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You'll be safe for awhile, Morri - rest, recuperate...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Are you leaving again?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (With a somber smile) I need to find Roshumba</line>

<stage>Amy brings over a flask of water and covers 
 Morrigan with a blanket.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> She will come for you here</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Roshumba?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Not quite</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Who?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You'll know</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Why?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Try to stay quiet</line>

<stage>Covering herself with the other blanket, 
 Amy heads out the way they came in.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> 'Bye bye, Fairy Godmother</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Under a desk in the KCON newsroom, Zachary 
 Isaacson and Justine Mirabello are busy looking for Gracie when the 
 earthquake hits. They ride it out under a desk. After a few moments, 
 they peek out at the even more disheveled newsroom.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> THAT was big</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> I've had bigger</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> We better stay here in case of an aftershock</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> What if that was the FORESHOCK?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Rubbing his head) ALWAYS THE OPTIMIST, JUSTI</line>

<stage>Zach slowly gets to his feet and calls across 
 the floor.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> GRACIE... DAMMIT, FINGERS, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE 
 YOU?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> You STILL haven't told me how my sister is mixed 
 up in this mess with McBride and Father Freaky - and I'm not leaving 
 UNTIL you do</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Getting up) I promise, I'll tell you everything 
 I know - but, right now, we need to find Takanachi - she said she was 
 here at Morri's cube, let's go!</line>

<stage>As they get to the empty cubicle, the entire 
 floor erupts into a stampede of KCON workers, including Kylee Shepperton.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Rolling her eyes and sighing) ISAACSON, YOU SPEND 
 MORE TIME HERE THAN YOU DO AT YOUR REAL JOB</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Serious) Kylee, have you seen Gracie?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Do I look like her social calendar?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> You look like someone's little black book</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> And your business here is what, Justine?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I'm serious, Shepperton, HAVE YOU SEEN GRACIE?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Tilting her head) NO, I HAVE NOT - and she better 
 get her fat ass in here, with everything that's going on, we're understaffed, 
 no thanks to your fugitive pal McBride</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> FUGITIVE, what are you talking about?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Maybe if your did your JOB, you'd know 
 what's going on 
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_kylee_zach.jpg" h="447" w="510"></p>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> IS MY SISTER WITH HER?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) WHAT?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> WHAT ELSE HAPPENED BESIDES THE EARTHQUAKE?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Oh, not all that much... just lawmen unleashing 
 the hounds on KCON's former fuzzy bunny girl, an explosion of some kind 
 by the bay involving the Coast Guard, ooh, and it's coming over the 
 wire now that Karl von Meer suffered a massive heart attack - is that 
 enough?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> DEAR GOD</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Now, if you both will excuse me, I have a job 
 to do - you might want to call your paper and see if you still have 
 one, Zachary</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Taking off like a shot) I HAVE GOT TO FIND 
 MY SISTER</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Also taking off) I NEED TO FIND GRACIE</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Shaking her head) GOOD LORD Y'ALL, GO FIND SOMETHING... 
 LIKE A STICK OF DEODORANT AND SOME EYEBROW TWEEZERS AT LEAST</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Pacing the halls of Bay Valley Medical Center, 
 KJ von Meer tries to comfort his mother, Pauline, who is on her cell 
 phone to family and friends.</stage>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Sobbing) Why can't we find your sister?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> We will, mom, we will</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> What if she's trapped by the earthquake?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I don't think it was strong enough for that - we 
 only felt a slight rolling here</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Shaking) Maybe I should call Griffin again</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Taking the phone out of her hand) Mom... Erika will 
 be fine, let's just concentrate on dad</line>

<stage>The two hug each other.</stage>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> Why aren't they telling us anything?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> They will as soon as they know something</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> He seemed a little tired and pale yesterday, 
 I should have done something...</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Mom...</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> He shouldn't have had that horrid appetizer 
 tonight...</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Please don't start looking for blame right now</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> I NEED TO DO SOMETHING, KJ, I NEED TO DO SOMETHING</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Flipping open the phone) OK - let's try calling...</line>

<stage>Dr. Stephanie Gates Martel emerges from 
 the emergency room with her head down.</stage>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> STEPH</line>

<stage>She slowly approaches the von Meer wife 
 and son.</stage>

<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Instantly recognizing the look on her face) 
 OH GOD, OH GOD, NO...</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Voice cracking) DAD?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Taking a deep breath) Is Erika here?</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> We... we can't find her</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Reaching out to both of them) Pauline... 
 Karl John... I'm... so sorry</line>

<stage>Pauline falls to her knees and covers her 
 mouth.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Tears streaming down his face) NO, STEPHANIE, YOU'RE 
 WRONG</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> KJ</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Turning red) GO BACK IN THERE AND DO SOMETHING ELSE 
 - THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE - WE CAN AFFORD SOMETHING ELSE</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Wiping her eyes) There IS nothing else, 
 Kiddo, we tried everything, I swear it!</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Choking on her tears) ERIKA, WE NEED ERIKA 
 HERE</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Trying to compose himself) What... what exactly 
 happened to dad?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> We're not 100% certain but it appears 
 to have been a massive heart attack</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> He had a complete physical a few months ago and he 
 was fine!</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Sometimes... these things just happen</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Yeah, they happen to OTHER PEOPLE</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Clutching his shoulder) We'll know for 
 sure after the post mortem</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Jumping up) NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT, I WILL NOT 
 HAVE HIM CARVED UP LIKE... LIKE A SIDE OF BEEF</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> We need to determine...</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> I WANT TO SEE HIM NOW</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> When we were working on him... we opened 
 his chest to keep his heart beating - there's a lot of blood</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Ready to throw up) Oh, dad!</line>
<line><actor>Pauline</actor> (Trembling) I DON'T CARE, I WANT TO SEE HIM</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Hesitant) I can let you two look behind 
 the glass until he's properly cleaned up</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Insistent) THAT IS THE VERY BEST I CAN 
 DO... for now</line>

<stage>She leads the two of them to the window 
 and lets them spend a few minutes grieving. She excuses herself and 
 watches their overwhelmed and still confused reactions from around the 
 corner. After they finally step away the viewing area, Dr. Stephanie 
 carefully wheels the body of Karl senior into another room down the 
 hall. He is still breathing.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Administering some medication) I'm sorry 
 I had to do that to your family, Karl, but someone tried to poison you... 
 and almost succeeded</line>

<stage>She takes his hand in hers and gently rubs 
 it.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Until I figure out who that person 
 is, it's best that everyone thinks you're dead 
</line>
<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c01_karl_steph.jpg" h="456" w="510"></p>

<stage>Making sure the room is secure, she dials 
 out on the wall phone.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Hector... I need your help</line>
