<stage>Creeping along the Santa Conchita riverbank in Tim's
 Jeep, Erika returns to the mountains.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Pulling over and jumping out) I believe it was around
 here somewhere...</line>

<stage>She searches Tim's black bag and grabs a hold of something
 in the palm of her hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Holding her clenched fist in the air) This should help</line>

<stage>Like a shot, Erika now hurries off into the forest.
 Moments later, she comes to the rock with the trident.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> A-ha, there you are!</line>

<stage>Underneath the bloody prongs is a lifeless brown hood.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (To the trident) Good job</line>

<stage>She scans across the river to the Don Alessandro foothills.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Great aim, Morrigan</line>

<stage>Erika uses her foot to hold down the body and yanks
 the trident out of the flesh and rock. The hood suddenly comes to life
 and grabs her ankle.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> I don't think so...</line>

<stage>She swings the trident around and jabs the heavy balled
 end. The hood's skull is crushed against the rock. Blood and brain
 ooze all over her feet.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Messy, messy</line>

<stage>A loud explosion echoes down the canyon.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Looking in the distance) Now what?</line>

<stage>A few miles away, the KCON newsvan is in cinders. Joenne
 has tackled the agent with the launcher too late.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> JUSTINE</line>
<line><actor>Agent</actor> I... didn't have time</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Running towards the van) NO, OH NOOO</line>
<line><actor>Agent</actor> We didn't know...</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> WHY?</line>
<line><actor>Agent</actor> You told me to fire...</line>

<stage>Ignoring the agent, Joenne is now at the smoldering
 vehicle.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (In tears) Why was she here?</line>

<stage>There is a rustle in the shrubs. Both Joenne and the
 agent aim their weapons. Justine, all singed and shaken, throws up
 her hands.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU, JOEY</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> JUSTI</line>

<stage>Joenne runs over to her as Justine attempts to get up
 but stumbles backwards and falls on her rear.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> Ow</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Thank God you got out in time!</line>

<stage>The two embrace. Justine then punches Joenne hard on
 the arm.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE YOU DOING? - WHY DID YOU FIRE
 A MISSILE AT ME?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I WASN'T THE ONE WHO FIRED IT AND IF I DID, IT WOULDN'T
 HAVE BEEN ON PURPOSE</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> OH, THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> WHY DID YOU FOLLOW ME?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> WHY CAN'T YOU STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> YOU ARE MY FAMILY ERGO MY BUSINESS</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> ERGO?</line>

<stage>The agent with the launcher clears his throat and looks
 away.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I'm sorry... we couldn't allow anyone past a certain
 point - especially the media</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> We? - care to explain who WE is, Joey?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> C'mon, we gotta move</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> (Getting up slowly) I liked you better when you were
 a promiscuous street junkie</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Helping her) Yeah, so did I</line>

<stage>Sparks pop out of the newsvan remnants as they pass
 by.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> So much for Gracie's &quot;rolling turd&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> SHE WASN'T INSIDE, WAS SHE?</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> No, just me - I borrowed it to come look for you</line>

<stage>Joenne smiles at her sister. Justine suddenly pinches
 Joenne hard on the arm.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Hey!</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> And THAT was for knocking me out</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I can't believe my sister boosted a newsvan</line>

<stage>The two chuckle.</stage>

<line><actor>Agent</actor> What's the plan now, Mirabello?</line>

<stage>Joenne freezes in her tracks.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Aw shit, I almost forgot about it</line>

<stage>Joenne takes off running with the agent following and
 Justine lagging behind. They all arrive at the rock with the bloody
 brown hood.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> IT'S GONE, DAMMIT</line>
<line><actor>Agent</actor> What's gone?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> It must be in the area - ALL UNITS, SEARCH THESE COORIDINATES
 IMMEDIATELY</line>
<line><actor>Agent</actor> WHAT ARE WE SEARCHING FOR?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> You'll know it when you see it</line>

<stage>An out-of-breath Justine is busy checking out the hood
 body.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> And I though I've seen it all - wait a sec... a three-pronged
 entry wound</line>
<line><actor>Agent</actor> (To Joenne) She shouldn't be here</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I'll take full responsibility</line>
<line><actor>Justine</actor> And this guy's innards match Father Greg's - Joey,
 you need to explain all this to me, right now... and then I'll tell
 you what I know</line>

<stage>A support helicopter swoops down overhead.</stage>

<line><actor>Justine</actor> (To Joenne) Later, we need to move...</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Inside the tunnel, Griffin steps out of the limo as
 a wide-eyed KJ stares at the crew of hoods before them.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (To KJ) Quickly, let's go</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Their eyes...</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> It's the lighting</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Um... if you say so</line>

<stage>A blue hood beckons to Griffin. They follow it deeper
 into the tunnel.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> We need to meet with Father</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Doug? - what is he doing here?</line>

<stage>Griffin gives KJ a look but does not answer.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Nervous) Grif, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me
 what the deal is with this frat hazing?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You're already an exclusive member, Kage</line>

<stage>KJ reluctantly trails Griffin and the blue hood into
 a dimly-lit chamber. Other Clergy members stand and wait at an empty
 hall.</stage>

<p a="center"><img src="../graphics/y3c15_hood_cave.jpg" alt="" h="564" w="703"  b="0"></p>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Whispering to Griffin) Can you at least tell me why everyone
 is dressed like an overgrown Jawa?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Show some respect...</line>

<stage>The White Robed Leader floats down the hall and settles
 before them.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Bowing) These are our ultimate business partners</line>

<stage>KJ is speechless for a moment but chooses not to believe
 what is before his eyes.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> Killer wire trick but what does this have to do with shipping?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (To the White Hood) Greetings, Father - you summoned
 us?</line>
<line><actor>White Hood</actor> Drilling will commence in a matter of days - you
 need to be ready on your part</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Trying not to show panic) DAYS? - forgive me, but
 I was under the impression that we had weeks, even months?</line>
<line><actor>White Hood</actor> The timetable has been moved up</line>

<stage>The leader glides right by Griffin and goes before KJ.</stage>

<line><actor>White Hood</actor> Is he worthy?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Angered) Worthy of what? - your stupid little costume
 party?</line>

<stage>The von Meer son turns his back and starts to walk away.
 The leader snaps a finger, causing KJ to flip over several times. He
 lands hard on his side as the hoods snicker.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> MOTHER FUC...</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (To KJ) Stay down, shut it, and let me talk!</line>
<line><actor>White Hood</actor> You need to keep him under control, Martel</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Yes, Father</line>

<stage>A blue hood hands Griffin a laptop computer.</stage>

<line><actor>White Hood</actor> Study the plans - both of you will be needed for
 service very soon</line>

<stage>The White Hood begins to float away. KJ scrambles to
 his feet and runs after it.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> I don't do business with someone who's afraid to show me
 their face!</line>

<stage>The leader allows the KJ to pull back the white hood
 from its face.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> YOU</line>

<stage>It smiles and then delivers a sharp blow to KJ's jaw.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Back at her house, Morrigan slowly steps away from Tallulah's
 terrarium, her eyes trained on Amy the entire time. Amy smiles softly
 as her eyes glow and all the candles in the room ignite at the wave
 of her hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> I would never let any harm come to your pet, you
 know that</line>

<stage>Morrigan's eyes now match Amy's in color and intensity.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> But sacrificing me or Zach is not a problem?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> (Serious) Zachary is safe... and so are you, Marked
 One</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> No thanks to you and your creepy clan - and the name
 is Morrigan!</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> I never had a say in whether you lived...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Or died...</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> It's beyond that now - you know this</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Tell me to my face - are you going to kill me?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> I would never do that, I could never do that</line>

<stage>The two slowly circle each other around the room.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Peering out the window) Are you going to betray
 me to the hoods again?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Unfortunately, everything is already set in motion
 - they no longer have a need for you</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Right now</line>

<stage>Morrigan suddenly feels lightheaded and takes a seat.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You have been through a lot, you should get some
 rest</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Not until you tell me more about The Clergy</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> I'll get us something to eat, first</line>

<stage>Morrigan thinks for a second. Her hunger overrules her
 curiosity.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Fine</line>

<stage>As Amy leaves, Morrigan goes to take Tallulah out of
 her terrarium. At first, the tarantula cowers away but then quickly
 warms to her touch. Morrigan catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Wincing at the image) And people think spiders are
 scary</line>

<stage>Amy now returns with some bread, cheese, fruit, and
 tea.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You never had a problem with nature...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Excuse me?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Throughout your life - animals, plants, people -
 they're all drawn to you...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> My stepmom would disagree with that</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Heh, even the most bizarre creatures find you attractive</line>

<stage>Morrigan ponders quietly as she nibbles a slice of cheese.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Consider it a blessing for you get your strength
 from them</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Then why do I feel so damn weak right now?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> The fact that you even survived last night is a marvel</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Have I earned a colorful cape?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You might want to save that for your friend</line>

<stage>An alarmed Morrigan realizes that Amy knows about Darkfin.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Enough with delay tactics, tell me about The Clergy
 - now!</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Remember the legend KJ told you about Duquesa Bay?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Vaguely - some royal chick cheated on her dickwad
 husband with a monk</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> The duchess Leticia, her husband the admiral, and
 Padre Ernesto - the Spanish sought precious metals here long before
 California's Gold Rush days - but they discovered something else...</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Nereidium</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Yes, however, the missionaries and the Chumash natives
 were infiltrated by The Clergy... Padre Ernesto was one of them</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Sipping her tea) Go on</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Ernesto was sadistically beheaded by Bernardo Martinez
 for having an affair with his wife - this infuriated The Clergy and
 they hunted the admiral down and eviscerated him</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Chomping on an apple) Lovely</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> But not before the admiral had alerted Madrid about
 the presence of Metal del Demonio and El Clero - they were now exposed
 beyond fable and folklore - it's been an underground battle ever since</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> And where do I come into this?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You were born into this - as was I</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Mocking) Yay for us</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> As you grew up, you saw how the mark on your foot
 changed with age but you never questioned it?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Whenever I did, I was instantly hushed up - after
 my mother and brother died... I had other things on my mind</line>

<stage>Amethyst places a comforting hand on Morrigan's back.</stage>

<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> You have been watched since birth... before birth</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> By whom?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> Joe Tiszo, your family... and my Father</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Are you going to tell me about him?</line>
<line><actor>Amethyst</actor> When you tell me about Aleta Oscura</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Erika pulls the Jeep into a far back lot on the SCU
 campus. Making sure nobody is around, she climbs out with the trident
 and Tim's black bag in hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Leaving the keys under the seat) Thanks for the lift,
 Timmy</line>

<stage>She stealthily moves across campus until she reaches
 an unavoidable security kiosk. A plump, middle-aged guard is slurping
 coffee.</stage>

<line><actor>Guard</actor> (Wiping his mouth) How ya doin' tonight, Dr. von Meer?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Sorry, forgot my badge again</line>

<stage>He notices the trident and gives her a quizzical look.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Drama department property</line>

<stage>He winks and nods for her to go through.</stage>

<line><actor>Guard</actor> Hey</line>

<stage>She freezes.</stage>

<line><actor>Guard</actor> Real sorry about your dad</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Thanks</line>

<stage>Erika now heads down a hall, up a flight of stairs,
 and into the lab. She hides the bag and trident in a cabinet, then
 checks on some beakers and sample dishes.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> You better hope this antidote is working on my father,
 Rif</line>

<stage>Suddenly feeling faint, she staggers over to a chair
 and collects herself. After a few deep breaths, she checks her pulse.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> My levels are undoubtedly off</line>

<stage>After a minute of rest, Erika scribbles some notes in
 a book and checks her computer. Footsteps down the hall cause her to
 stiffen. They approach but never come inside.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Exhaling) I can't do this here</line>

<stage>She stashes some supplies in her pockets. Then she snatches
 Tim's black bag, grabs the trident and takes off. Erika makes her way
 to the beach from the campus.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Scanning around) At least Mt. Wiggins is keeping everyone
 preoccupied</line>

<stage>Erika now reaches the marina and her boat. Once inside,
 she downs a bottle of Gatorade and tosses the trident and black bag
 on the bed.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> Why does this have to be so hard, Sam?</line>

<stage>Completely exhausted, she falls on her bed and sobs
 uncontrollably. Her foot accidentally knocks the black bag on the floor.
 The contents spill everywhere.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Staring down at the floor) What are you looking at?</line>

<stage>Staring back is a human skull, dozens of Nereidium coins,
 and three sticks of dynamite.</stage>
