<chapter-title>Shot Through The Heart</chapter-title>

<stage>Thoroughly bored and swiveling around in her office chair, Erika von Meer listens to Griffin Martel drone on and on to the Meeramar employees about the recent break-in and resulting increased security measures.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> And I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, I am fine... a little unsettled but fine...</line>

<stage>Erika rolls her eyes as KJ shows up, taking a seat beside her.</stage>

<line><actor>KJ</actor> Did I miss anything?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> A vintage whine from Grif - what are you doing here?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I had some extra time and thought I'd swing by for company morale, that kind of thing - where's dad?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> He and Doug had some real business to take care of</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Strutting around the employees) The good news in all of this is that nothing of importance, work-wise, was taken</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Heh, he only lost some money and a watch - both of which he can easily replace... his pride is another thing</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> How did you know?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Know what?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Griffin didn't want anyone to know what was taken from him - he didn't even file a police report</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Catching herself) I've known the man, in every way, since we were born - I can easily deduce what he's hiding... and he's now wearing the watch I gave him three Christmases ago</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Smirking) Damn, Sis, you are in the wrong profession - you should be a detective</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Raising an eyebrow) I'm sure law enforcement would just love to have me</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Banging his fist down on a desk) And I promise every one of you that this kind of harrowing experience will NOT happen again!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Under her breath) PLEASE, Griffin, grow a spine</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Hearing what she said) Cut him some slack, Rik, you weren't there - it was pretty nasty the way he was tied up, and it could have been a lot worse</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> How's the security guard doing?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Better... he has a moderate concussion and the details are still fuzzy as to what went down</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> He didn't see his attacker?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> No... at least not a clear face - he mentioned something about a hood</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Huh... well, I suppose that's typical for a robbery</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> What I don't understand is why wait until Griffin was in a high security building? - it would have been easier to just jack him in a dark parking lot or something</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Obviously, the building wasn't secure enough</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I know, that's why I initially thought it was an inside job, someone trying to pirate corporate secrets</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What changed your mind?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Griffin - he swears to me that nothing was touched... she went right for his watch and money</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Coughing) SHE?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Yeah, he definitely said it was a woman's voice although she tried to disguise it... he's not sure but he thinks he's heard it before</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Stiffening) Really</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Concluding his address) Once again, we deeply appreciate and value your continued loyalty to Meeramar, I am more than confident that this was an isolated incident and it is indeed safe to come to work... thank you and goodnight!</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Flipping open his cell phone and dialing) Hey, Morrigan, it's Kage - look, I'm so sorry Isaacson was a jerk tonight - how about the two of us going for a hike this weekend? - call me back, 'bye!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What happened with Zach?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> We were all having a good time until Eyes started ragging on her about not drinking beer - wow, I'll tell ya, she sure shut everyone up and slaughtered the happy mood with her response!</line>

<stage>KJ looks off and shakes his head. There is a silent pause.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Impatient) WELL?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Hmm?</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What did she say?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Oh... it's a long, ugly story - let me try to sum it up in a sentence... she was involved in a drunk driving accident when she was a kid, her brother was killed and her mom's head ended up in her lap, something about Neil Diamond, and beer was the root cause</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> DEAR GOD</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> I know, I thought she was joking at first... you know  how writers love to tell stories... but I recognized from the expression  on her face that she wasn't</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Did she leave right after that?</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> Pretty much - Gracie said she took off for Saint Brendan's... probably to pray for some new friends</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Getting up) You know what, I forgot to check with Shelby on some lab results, please tell Grif...</line>

<stage>Griffin Martel now approaches them.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> You can tell me yourself, Rikka</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I apologize but I must get going</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Grabbing her elbow) Whatever it is will have to wait</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Snapping it back) Excuse me?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> We have some business to take care of</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Look, I was here all evening</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> And that's why you can spare another ten minutes... for me</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> Fine</line>
<line><actor>KJ</actor> (Winking at his sister) I'll see you two later</line>

<stage>Erika glowers at her brother as she follows behind Griffin.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Outside in the church parking lot, Morrigan and Joenne Mirabello continue their conversation.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Joenne, I really do not appreciate cryptic warnings - what are you talking about?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Who is &quot;Bouillabaisse?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Answer my question first - I want to know why I can't go inside the church?</line>

<stage>Joenne looks around and pulls Morrigan over to hidden archway.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> It is not safe for you inside</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Growing frustrated) YES, you already established that by saying I should &quot;value my life&quot; - WHY?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> I have reason to believe something is going to happen here tonight... in fact, I'm most certain of it</line>

<image  src="../graphics/y2c12_joenne_mori.jpg" h="423" w="520"  b="0"></image>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> What?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Nuh-uh, I answered your question, now tell me who Bouillabaisse is</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It's an important informant for a future KCON story, I cannot reveal the identity and I cannot say another word - in fact, WHY am I saying ANY words to a temp secretary?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> You sure enjoy the question, &quot;why&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> It's my job... it's my life</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Irritated) FYI, I am A LOT more than a temp secretary!</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm starting to figure that out - here's a new question for you - WHAT are you then?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Your one true ally in this town</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Shaking her head) Oh, Ms. Mirabello, PLEASE - this conversation is about eight seconds away from ending</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Let's just say we have a mutual enemy in The Clergy</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> What in the hell are you talking about? - I have no problems with this church!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Not THIS clergy... THE CLERGY - at least, that's the nickname we've given them - they have some ancient Latin title but it's easier to call them &quot;The Clergy&quot;</line>

<stage>Morrigan looks completely baffled.</stage>

<line><actor>Joenne</actor> How about &quot;Hooded Goons?&quot; - does that ring a bell, Morrigan?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Catching her breath) Oh</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Doing a pirouette for emphasis) Yep</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> How much do you know?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> PLENTY, I dare say more than you at this point</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Care to share?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Not here, not now</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Rubbing her head) Here we go again!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> What do you mean?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Is that all you know about... &quot;The Clergy?&quot; - is that it?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Why? - is there more I should know?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Evil grin) Not here, not now</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> HA - I'll be sure to tell my superiors that</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Something tells me these &quot;superiors&quot; are concerned with more than the copying machine</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Let's just say that a certain segment of the United States government has taken notice of Duquesa Bay recently... and it's not for the waterfront property</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Tell me, is Justine in on this, too?</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> NO, my sister is NOT involved nor does she need to be... is that understood?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Of course</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> So, do you trust me?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> How about a firm &quot;maybe?&quot;</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> Hey, I took a big risk in revealing myself to you here tonight - please get back in your car and go home - we'll rendezvous in a few days</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> CALL me, don't IM me!</line>
<line><actor>Joenne</actor> (Quizzical stare) Whatever</line>

<stage>Inside the parish hall, Hector Tapia speaks with Carmen and Frank Fiore as the church business is concluded.</stage>

<line><actor>Carmen</actor> (All smiles) Padre Juan was telling me about a significant anonymous donation made to Saint B's yesterday and that they have generously agreed to split it with &quot;Our Lady&quot; - we can finally get the air conditioning fixed!</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Grumbling) I already fixed it</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> You TRIED to fix it</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Looking at his watch) Morrigan should have been here by now, I wonder what's keeping her?</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> It's probably for the best that she doesn't come here - we don't need news people poking around our ancestors' burial grounds</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> Isn't it her job to poke around?</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> When there is a STORY to be told - the Chumash resting place in the Kiyomis has already been told and retold</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Maybe she's approaching it from another angle?</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> We don't need KCON's angle of exploitation</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> Ms. McBride is NOT that kind of journalist, Carmenita, you have my word on this</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> Hmm... and what &quot;word&quot; is that, hermano?</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> (Chuckling) Can I pick it out?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Sighing) I'm going to go check for her outside, please do not leave here until I return</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> Diez minutos solamente!</line>

<stage>Hector nods to his sister as he heads for the door. Exiting the side entrance, he spots Morrigan getting back into her car.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> MS. MCBRIDE, WAIT</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (To herself) Aww, damn!</line>

<stage>Hector jogs over to her car.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> I was just coming to see where you were - why are you leaving?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I'm sorry, Hector - I ate some bad pizza and I'm not really up to this right now</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> I'm sorry - I think Father Greg has some antacid, let me go see</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Starting the engine) UM - no, really, that's OK - please tell your sister I would love to reschedule in the next few days but I genuinely need to go home... now</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Somewhat hurt) Alright... please feel better soon</line>

<stage>Hector watches Morrigan drive off and heads back towards the church. He is distracted along the way by a broken sprinkler head. Over the next several minutes, he goes about fixing it when a loud bang suddenly cracks the air. The screams of a woman quickly follow.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Running inside the church) CARMEN... CARMEN</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> HECTOR, COME QUICK</line>

<stage>He runs into the chapel and finds a handful of people gathered around a fallen priest.</stage>


<image  src="../graphics/y2c12_priest.jpg" h="466" w="520"  b="0"></image>

<line><actor>Carmen</actor> FATHER GREG HAS BEEN SHOT</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> DID ANYONE SEE WHAT HAPPENED?</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> NO, WE ALL RAN IN HERE AFTER WE HEARD THE BANG</line>

<stage>Hector kneels next to the bleeding man and finds no pulse. He tries to put pressure on the gaping chest wound but, in his mind, he knows it is futile.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> CALL THE POLICE</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> (Sobbing) Gladys is already doing that</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> (Hobbling towards the door) I'M GONNA GET MY RIFLE OUT OF THE TRUCK - THE SHOOTER MIGHT STILL BE IN HERE</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> SIT DOWN, FRANCIS, YOU'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY</line>

<stage>Frank ignores him and disappears behind the ornately carved oak door as Carmen begins to pray. Moments later, the Fiore patriarch returns with a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.</stage>

<line><actor>Hector</actor> DAMMIT, FRANK, PUT THAT AWAY, WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE TROUBLE</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> (Inspecting it) It's not mine</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> What do you mean?</line>
<line><actor>Frank</actor> Padre Juan and I found it on the church steps</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> And now your prints are on it... PERFECTO</line>
<line><actor>Carmen</actor> PLEASE, PLEASE, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE HELP FATHER GREG?</line>
<line><actor>Hector</actor> (Taking her hand) Help is on the way... but I'm afraid it's too late</line>

<stage>Carmen looks down at the blood on Hector's fingers and runs out of the room, wailing with the other women.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Casually taking a seat on the leather sofa inside his office, Griffin motions to Erika to join him. There is a small, candlelit dinner laid out on the table.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Crab salad... your favorite!</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Tempted by the meal) Griffin, I honestly don't have time for this</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I am making you find the time</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> I thought you said this had to do with business?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Everything we do affects our family, ergo, it affects the business</line>

<stage>Erika huffs and takes a bite of the salad.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> I need you...</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> GRIFFIN</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> LET ME FINISH... I need you to work with me on a very important project - I was hoping your brother could handle it... but you know KJ</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> What does this involve?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Sit and relax, eat your salad, I have a video presentation that will help make sense</line>

<stage>He turns on one of the video monitors on the wall and it shows a security camera view of the interior.</stage>

<line><actor>Griffin</actor> Whoops - forgot to get rid of this first</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Slightly recognizing it) What is it?</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> The intruder who attacked me the other night used a video loop on the surveillance tape - fortunately, the electronic equipment required to pull it off was left behind during the excitement - it's only a matter of time before my people track down its source</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Almost dropping her fork) That's fortunate</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> (Resetting the monitor) Ah, this should do it</line>

<stage>Before he has a chance to start the tape, the monitor is on regular television. Flashing across the screen is a breaking KCON news story.</stage>

<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Eyes lighting up) WAIT... DON'T SWITCH IT YET</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> But...</line>
<line><actor>Erika</actor> (Grabbing the remote and turning it up) SHHHHH</line>

<stage>Dan Henshaw is on screen with an image of Saint Brendan's church in the background.</stage>

<line><actor>Dan</actor> We have breaking news at this hour - a reported shooting has taken place at Saint Brendan's Catholic Church where at least one person has been killed - we are expecting more details any moment now as...</line>
<line><actor>Griffin</actor> GREAT, that's all this town needs</line>

<stage>Before he can say another word, Erika bolts out of the room.</stage>
