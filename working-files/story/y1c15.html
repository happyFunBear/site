<h2>Thirty Minutes After Midnight</h2>

<p><img  b="0" h="228" w="320" src="../graphics/y1c15_hospital_night.jpg"></p>


<stage>Inside the emergency room of Bay Valley Medical Center, Penny and George Renselier wait as Lydia is treated for her wounds. &nbsp;Brad Martel paces in the hall, eyeing Penny as her father speaks on his cell phone.</stage>

<line><actor>George</actor> Yes, we're waiting to hear now - no, we're still not sure what happened - it was terrible, I'm so glad you weren't there</line>

<stage>Realizing his daughter is glowering at him, he turns in his seat and speaks in a hushed tone.</stage>

<line><actor>George</actor> I'll be by tomorrow - I love you, too</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Arms folded) I have no idea who your new playmate is and I could, quite frankly, care less BUT I do care about my mother, YOUR WIFE, who is going through multiple levels of shit right now - stick the cell up your ass and show some respect!</line>

<stage>The elder Renselier thinks about a retort, decides against one and quickly puts the phone away in his pocket as Brad chuckles in the corner. &nbsp;Dr. Stephanie Gates emerges from the other room.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> Aunt Steph, is mom alright?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> A few cuts and bruises, elevated blood pressure, she'll be fine</line>

<stage>Both Renseliers breathe a sigh of relief.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> She's very lucky - the gash to her neck, if it were three centimeters deeper, Lyd would be in real trouble right now</line>

<stage>Penny covers her faces and rubs it.</stage>

<line><actor>George</actor> Can we see her?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Sure, go on in - she's sedated but still coherent</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Pausing) How are the others that were brought in? - Mr. Braemar?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Mostly minor wounds, Mr. Braemar is the only critical one - he's in surgery right now</line>

<stage>Inching closer, Brad is standing in back of Penny.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Looking at her niece and her son) The paramedics say if it weren't for you two, he'd be dead right now</line>

<stage>The scruffy man and the exhausted girl look at each other and then quickly look away. &nbsp;The Renselier daughter goes inside to see her mother.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Watching Brad watch Penny) Why are you really here, Bradley?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Scratching his face) To check up on Mr. Braemar, of course... actually, mom, I was wondering if I could stay with you for a few days?</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> What happened?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I was kinda evicted</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> Again?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> IT WASN'T MY FAULT</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> No, it never is</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> I asked dad but he only told me to grow up - Grif and Vicky won't return my calls - Ben said I could stay with him but Claudia insists I sleep in the garage</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> What about your friends? - you know what, forget about those creeps</line>

<stage>Sighing, she fetches her house key from her pocket and tosses it to Brad.</stage>

<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> We'll discuss this further when I get home</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (All smiles) Thanks!</line>
<line><actor>Dr. Stephanie</actor> (Hearing her name paged) I'm not doing you any favors</line>

<stage>She takes off as Brad tries to peek inside the door at Penny. &nbsp;Lydia opens her eyes and squeezes her husband's hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> George - I need to...</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> (Patting the hand) Shh, you need to do nothing but rest, doctor's orders!</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Penelope - please get my assistant on the phone</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Mom, that's not a good idea right now</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> PLEASE</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> (Diving into her father's pocket) I don't have Brenda's number with me</line>

<stage>Mrs. Renselier rattles off the number as her daughter rolls her eyes and dials.</stage>

<line><actor>Penny</actor> Hi, Bren - yeah, mom's fine - she wants to know... WHAT?</line>

<stage>Lydia grabs the phone out of Penny's hand.</stage>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Brenda, what's going on? - WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY TAKE THAT?</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> What's wrong?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Along with the Duquesa's Tears, some mission statue was stolen</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Keep me informed, I'll be there as soon as I can</line>

<stage>Throwing the phone down on the bed, Lydia tries to keep from crying.</stage>

<line><actor>George</actor> Did they steal anything else?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> DIDN'T THEY STEAL ENOUGH?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Mom, calm down</line>

<p><img  b="0" h="291" w="200" src="../graphics/y1c15statues.jpg" a="center"></p>

<line><actor>Lydia</actor> Brenda and the police checked through everything a half dozen times - the only two items taken were the necklace and the mission statue</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> I can understand the necklace but what's so special about that statue?</line>
<line><actor>Lydia</actor> It doesn't make any sense, we have several of those very same statues in storage - they were mass produced by the Chumash for the Spanish missionaries to sell back in Europe - they have a value of several hundred dollars, tops!</line>
<line><actor>George</actor> Try not to think about it now, Liddy - let's concentrate on getting you home</line>

<stage>A nurse comes in to take her vitals.</stage>

<line><actor>Nurse</actor> (To Penny) Ms. Renselier, there's a young man in the hall waiting to see you</line>

<stage>Penelope storms out of the room to find her boyfriend Jeremey hanging out by the vending machines.</stage>

<line><actor>Jere</actor> (Rushing over to her) Pen, are you OK? - Gracie called and told me...</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> Why weren't you at the ball?</line>
<line><actor>Jere</actor> Sorry, I didn't really feel like going - besides, I had to help out at Techtonic - I GOT TO DO MY OWN SET, isn't that rad?</line>
<line><actor>Penny</actor> FUCK YOU</line>

<stage>She turns and heads back into her mother's room. &nbsp;Watching from the side, Brad saunters over to a confused Jere and snickers.</stage>

<line><actor>Jere</actor> What's your problem?</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Jere, Jere, Jere - little boy, she is SO out of your league</line>

<stage>The young man stiffens up and clenches his teeth.</stage>

<line><actor>Jere</actor> (Scanning Brad's cowboy costume) You better hurry or you'll miss your YMCA number</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> Heh, you better hurry and grow some dick before your girlfriend turns elsewhere to find it</line>

<stage>The two get in a shoving match.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> Chill out, dude, I was just giving you some friendly advice</line>
<line><actor>Jere</actor> (Trying to get in a solid punch) You know what you can do with your advice!</line>
<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Pushing Jere back into a chair) Hey, I wouldn't want you to hurt those magic music hands of yours!</line>

<stage>A hospital orderly rushes over and escorts them out of the building. &nbsp; Jeremey takes off on his bike as Brad zooms by him in his black truck.</stage>

<line><actor>Brad</actor> (Stopping and rolling down the window) Styling wheels, man, I'm sure the ladies love riding on your handlebars!</line>

<stage>The Martel brother cackles and takes off again. &nbsp;About a half mile down the road, his truck makes a grinding noise and lurches to a stop. &nbsp;With a mock wave and smile, Jeremey rides past him.</stage>

<bar></bar>

<stage>As the turmoil in and around the Quartz County Museum lessens just a bit, KCON's best field producer, Gracie Takanachi, finishes collecting and editing her footage as the Daily Beacon's Zachary Isaacson trots over with his notes.</stage>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Did you find Morri yet?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> No, and there a few other people missing as well - I saw Griffin and he's frantically looking for Dr. von Meer</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Huh, maybe they panicked and ran for the hills, I know I'd still be running from this mess</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> It doesn't seem like M&amp;M to run</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Checking some wires) I know - and that's what has me really concerned</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Before I was kicked out by the cops, I saw a ton of blood and spent ammo in the courtyard, more than just a jewelry heist went down here tonight</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Watching another emergency vehicle take off) Was anyone killed?</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> I can't get a confirmation but I highly suspect so</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Taking a deep breath) OK, keeping the train wreck in mind, we are NOT going to think the worst</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> (Thinking the worst) Right</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Morrigan is probably following a lead somewhere and she'll get in touch with us when she's ready</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> That or her body will float up somewhere</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Bopping him on the arm) ZACH</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> WHAT? - you told me to think about what happened with the train wreck!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Look, we have jobs to do, let's just do them</line>

<stage>Isaacson notices a disheveled Kylee Shepperton hurrying over to them.</stage>

<line><actor>Zach</actor> (To Gracie) Speaking of jobs</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Grace, do you have some notes for me to look at?</line>

<p><img  b="0" h="207" w="215" src="../graphics/y1c15kylee.jpg" a="center"></p>

<line><actor>Gracie</actor> Benny said Steel was coming over to do the stand-up?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Fixing her makeup) Well, Benny is wrong - Claudia is not here, I am, let's go!</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Gee, Kyleekins, how come you just got here? - weren't you supposed to be at this fancy shindig?</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Setting up for the shot) You're in my way, Zach, MOVE</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Handing Kylee her notes) Funny, I haven't seen Mr. Gates around, either</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> If you MUST know, we were both tied up in meetings with the network executives</line>
<line><actor>Zach</actor> Were Prussick knots involved?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Checking in with the station) Closing in on one minute</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> (Putting in her IFB) Look, I wanted to be here - getting stuck in a meeting was not my first choice</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Under her breath) &quot;Stuck&quot; is the operative word you corporate fuck doll</line>
<line><actor>Kylee</actor> EXCUSE ME?</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> (Fake smile) I said, &quot;it's a good thing you're here afterall&quot;</line>

<stage>Zach swallows his laughter.</stage>

<line><actor>Kylee</actor> Because of the deal we struck at the meeting tonight, you will have a paycheck this week, Ms. Takanachi, you'd be wise to remember that!</line>
<line><actor>Gracie</actor> And you'd be wise to remember your in cue - 30 SECONDS</line>

<bar></bar>

<stage>Still tracking the cloaked figure running with the large sack, Morrigan edges close to the waterfront. &nbsp;The thickening fog is making it more difficult to see. &nbsp;The figure starts to slow down in the sand.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (To herself) What do I do now?</line>

<stage>The figure pauses and looks towards the sea, waiting. &nbsp;Stumbling over a large clump of washed up kelp, Morrigan has an idea. &nbsp;She grabs a long strand of the thick vegetation to use as a rope and carefully approaches the figure.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (In her mind) On the count of three... one, two, HAAA</line>

<stage>She throws the kelp rope around the figure and pulls it tight against him. &nbsp; He's thrown to the ground and remains motionless.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> GOTCHA - what's in the bag pal?</line>
<line><actor>Figure</actor> (Deep and eerie) You'll figure it out</line>

<stage>Instantly recognizing the same voice that warned her on the phone earlier, she carefully goes to check the contents. &nbsp;The figure snaps the seaweed around him and deftly hurls Morrigan towards the ocean. &nbsp;Landing hard in the surf, the KCON reporter screams for help as the figure calmly gathers the sack and heads off into the fog. &nbsp;Trying to recuperate from her head fin injury, Darkfin hears the commotion and swims over to investigate. &nbsp;She observes Morrigan now running along the beach, batting at the fog around her.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Trying to catch her breath) I know he went in this direction... I think - DAMMIT - WHERE ARE YOU, YOU HOODED COWARD?</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Following her at a distance) That sounds familiar</line>

<p><img  b="0" h="220" w="420" src="../graphics/y1c15chopper_night.jpg"></p>


<stage>In the skies over Duquesa Bay, Lieutenant Fiore pilots the helicopter as Captain Phelps searches the waters below with a large spotlight.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> They HAVE to be here</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> We've search up and down, there are no boats - our teams in the water have given the all clear - I don't know about you, but I'm tired of dancing in the dark</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Keep looking</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> FOR GODSAKES CAPTAIN, there's nothing out here except a lonely seal and increasing fog - we need to get back</line>

<stage>A disgusted Craig frowns at the fog and slams his hand against the window.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> Look, the police have every road in and out of town blocked off - we will continue to search every ship that leaves the Bay area for the next year if we have to - if that necklace is still here, we'll find it!</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Sighing) You're right, lieutenant, let's return to base</line>

<stage>After running up the coast for several miles, a bewildered Morrigan collapses on the shore as she realizes her increasingly painful shoulder was dislocated by being thrown by the cloaked figure.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Looking up into the fog) This is stupid, that guy is long gone - I need to go back and get help</line>

<p><img  b="0" h="311" w="220" src="../graphics/y1c15beach_night.jpg" a="center"></p>


<stage>As she starts to her knees, she feels two, cold, slimy hands firmly grab a hold of her neck.</stage>

<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (In back of Morrigan) Remain still or die</line>

<stage>The odd, female voice is not the one of the cloaked figure. &nbsp;Overwhelmed by the same feeling she had on the night she first entered town and again in the Santa Conchita River, McBride tries to keep as calm as she can.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Who are you?</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> Your worst nightmare</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Can you be a little more original?</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> Tell me about the man in the robe</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Gasping) I would if I could breathe</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Only slightly loosening her grip) Did he say anything to you?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Not really, I saw him running from the museum with a sack, I followed him here</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> You never lost sight of him?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Would you mind taking your slimy hands off me?</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> ANSWER THE QUESTION</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Maybe for a few moments but never for very long</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Disturbed) He must have friends</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Do you have friends?</line>
<line><actor>Darkfin</actor> (Looking up at the approaching helicopter) Do not worry about what is in back of you, focus on what is directly in front of you!</line>

<stage>Suddenly, Morrigan feels a sharp blow to the back of her head and blacks out. &nbsp;As Craig gives one last sweep with the spotlight, he notices movement by the tidal pools.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> DID YOU SEE THAT?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> What?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> I just saw something</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Tugging on his costume sleeve) Blackbeard's treasure?</line>

<stage>The captain aims the spotlight on the shore and discovers a woman's body.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> OH GOD</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> TAKE IT DOWN</line>

<stage>The Coast Guard helicopter quickly descends and lands on the shore. &nbsp;Craig runs over as Anita radios for assistance.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Gently turning her over) JESUS, IT'S MCBRIDE - she's alive!</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Running up to them with a first aid kit) What is up with this chica?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Checking her over) It looks like someone konked her pretty hard in back of the head</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> An ambulance is on its way</line>

<p><img  b="0" h="248" w="236" src="../graphics/anita_headshot.gif" a="center"></p>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Administering smelling salts) Ms. McBride, MORRIGAN - do you understand me?</line>

<stage>Covered in sand and soaked in sea water, she gags on the smell and flutters her eyes.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> What... what happened?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Why don't you tell us?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Where did...</line>

<stage>Thinking of the cold hands around her neck, she stops herself before she says anything more.</stage>

<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Captain Phelps?</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Getting in her face) Finish your thought - &quot;where did&quot; WHAT?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Now sitting up) Where did the guy go I was chasing?</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> (Looking around) What guy?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I saw someone running away from the museum with a sack</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> I KNEW IT</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> What did he look like?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I don't know, he was in a hooded robe</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> Why didn't you go for help?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I didn't have time and I didn't have my cell phone</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Then what happened?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> I caught up to him, we struggled and that's all I remember</line>

<stage>Craig takes off to search the area as Morrigan slowly rises to her feet.</stage>

<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Giving her a hand) Maybe you should stay on the ground, you have one wicked welt on the back of your head</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Pulling away) I'll be fine</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> (Noticing the unusual red marks around the woman's neck) Did he try to strangle you?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> Uh, I guess</line>
<line><actor>Anita</actor> Did he say anything?</line>
<line><actor>Morrigan</actor> (Reflecting) Focus on what is directly in front of you</line>
<line><actor>Craig</actor> ANITA</line>

<stage>The lieutenant bolts off in the direction of her captain's yell with Morrigan staggering behind. &nbsp;All three stare at a tidal pool illuminated by Craig's flashlight. &nbsp;The Duquesa's Tears lie among the tiny starfish, anemones, urchins and limpets.</stage>

<line><actor>Craig</actor> Blackbeard's treasure for sure!</line>
